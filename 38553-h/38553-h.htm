<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago a collection of short stories under
the title, "Emmy Lou: Her Book And Heart," was
offered to the American public as a plea for and a
defense of the child as affected by the then prevailing
stupidity of the public schools.</p>

<p>The present series of stories is written to show
that the same conditions which in the school make for
confusion in the child's mind, exist in the home,
in the Sunday school and in all its earlier points of
contact with life; the child who presents itself at
six or even at five, to the school and teacher, being
already well on the way in the school of life, and
its habits of mind established.</p>

<p>It is the contention of these new stories that
the child comes single-minded to the experience of
life. That it brings to this experience a fundamental,
if limited, conception of ethics, justice, consistency
and obligation. That it is the possessor of
an innate conscience that teaches it to differentiate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
between right and wrong, and that the failure to
find an agreement between ethics and experience confronts
the child long before its entrance at school.</p>

<p>Not only do its conceptions fail to square with
life as it finds it, but the practices and habits of
the persons it looks up to fail to square with what
these elders claim for life. Further, the child meets
with an innate stupidity on the part of its elders
that school cannot surpass, a stupidity which assumes
knowledge on the child's part that it cannot
possibly have.</p>

<p>These conditions make for confusion in the child's
mind, and a consequent impairment of its reasoning
faculties, before it presents itself to the school.</p>

<p>Given the very young child struggling to evolve
its working rule out of nebul&aelig;, how do its elders
aid it? The isolated fact without background or
connection, the generalization with no regard to
its particular application, the specific rule that will
not fit the general case&mdash;these too often are its portion,
resulting in lack of perspective, no sense of proportion,
and no grasp of values. The child's conceptions
of the cardinal virtues, the moral law, the
fatherhood of God, the brotherhood of Christ,
the human relation, are true, garbled, or false,
in accordance with the interpreting of its elders.</p>

<p>The child thus has been in the training of the
home, the neighborhood, and the Sunday school,
for approximately four, three, and two years respectively,
before it comes to the school of letters.</p>

<p>One of the intelligences thrashing out the problems
of the school today, says:</p>

<p>"Education begins at the age of two or sooner,
whether the parent wills it or not. The home influence
from two to six, for good or ill in determining
the mental no less than the moral status, is the
most permanent thing in the child's life. Even at the
age of five, the difficulty for the teacher in making
a beginning, lies in the fact that the beginning already
has been made."</p>

<p>In the original stories portraying the workings
of the schoolroom on the mind of the child, the
physically normal, mentally sound but slow type
was used, in the child called Emmy Lou, and in now
seeking to show that the conditions making for more
or less permanent confusion in the child's mind antedate
the schoolroom, it has seemed wise to make
use of the same child in the same environment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<h2>I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>OUT OF GOD'S BLESSING INTO THE WARM SUN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a day or two after Emmy Lou, four
years old, came to live with her uncle and her
aunties, or in fact until she discovered Izzy
who lived next door and Sister who lived in
the alley, Aunt Cordelia's hands were full.
But it was Emmy Lou's heart that was full.</p>

<p>Along with other things which had made
up life, such as Papa, and her own little white
bed, and her own little red chair, and her own
window with its sill looking out upon her own
yard, and Mary the cook in Mary's own kitchen,
and Georgie the little neighbor boy next
door&mdash;along with these things, she wanted
Mamma.</p>

<p>Not only because she was Mamma, all-wise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
all-final, all-decreeing, but because, being
Mamma and her edicts therefore supreme, she
had bade her little daughter never to forget to
say her prayers.</p>

<p>Not that Emmy Lou <i>had</i> forgotten to say
them. Not she! It was that when she went
to say them she had forgotten what she was to
say. A terrifying and unlooked-for contingency.</p>

<p>Two days before, Papa had put his Emmy
Lou into the arms of Aunt Cordelia at the
railroad station of the city where she and Aunt
Katie and Aunt Louise and Uncle Charlie
lived. They had come to the train to get her.
As he did so, Mamma, for whose sake the trip
south was being made in search of health,
though Emmy Lou did not know this, smiled
and tried to look brave.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou's new little scarlet coat with its
triple capes was martial, and also her new
little scarlet Napoleon hat, three-cornered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a cockade, and Papa hastened to assume that
the little person within this exterior was martial
also.</p>

<p>"Emmy Lou is a plucky soul and will not
willingly try you, Cordelia," he told his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"Emmy Lou is a faithful soul and has <i>promised</i>
not to try you," said Mamma.</p>

<p>"Kiss Mamma and kiss me," said Papa.</p>

<p>"And say your prayers every night at Aunt
Cordelia's knee," said Mamma.</p>

<p>"Pshaw," said Uncle Charlie, the brother
of Mamma and the aunties, and wheeling
about and whipping out his handkerchief he
blew his nose violently.</p>

<p>"Brother!" said Aunt Katie reproachfully.
Aunt Katie was younger than Mamma and almost
as pretty.</p>

<p>"Brother Charlie!" said Aunt Louise who
was the youngest of them all, even more reproachfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I send her to Sunday school at our
church, or at your church?" said Aunt Cordelia,
plump and comfortable, and next to
Uncle Charlie in the family succession. For
Papa's church was different, though Emmy
Lou did not know this either&mdash;and when
Mamma had elected to go with him there had
been feeling.</p>

<p>"So she finds God's blessing, Sister Cordelia,
what does it matter?" said Mamma a
little piteously. "And she'll say her prayer
every night and every morning to you?"</p>

<p>On reaching home, Aunt Cordelia spoke
decidedly, "Precious baby! We'll give her
her supper and put her right into her little
bed. She's worn out with the strangeness of
it all."</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia was right. Emmy Lou was
worn out and more, she was bewildered and
terrified with the strangeness of it all. But
though her flaxen head, shorn now of its brave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
three-cornered hat, fell forward well-nigh into
her supper before more than a beginning was
made, and though when carried upstairs by
Uncle Charlie she yielded passively to Aunt
Cordelia and Aunt Katie undressing her, too
oblivious, as they deemed her, to be cognizant
of where she was, they reckoned without knowing
their Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>Her head came through the opening of the
little gown slipped on her.</p>

<p>"Shall I say it now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Her prayer. She hasn't forgotten, precious
baby," said Aunt Cordelia and sat down.
Aunt Katie who had been picking up little
garments, melted into the shadows beyond
the play and the flicker of the fire in the
grate, and Emmy Lou, steadied by the
hand of Aunt Cordelia, went down upon her
knees.</p>

<p>For there are rules. Just as inevitably as
there are rites. And since life is hedged about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with rites, as varying in their nature as in their
purpose, and each according to its purpose at
once inviolate and invincible, it is for an Emmy
Lou to concern herself with remembering their
rules.</p>

<p>As when she goes out on the sidewalk to
play "I-spy" with Georgie, the masterful
little boy from next door, and his friends.
Whereupon and unvaryingly follows the rite.
The rule being that all stand in a row, and
while the moving finger points along the line,
words cabalistic and potent in their spell cryptically
and irrevocably search out the quaking
heart of the one who is "It."</p>

<p>So in the kitchen. The rule being that
Mary, who is young and pretty and learning
to cook under Mamma's tutelage, shall chant
earnestly over the crock as she mixes, words
which again are talismanic and potent in their
spell, as "one of butter, two of sugar, three of
flour, four eggs," or Mary's cake infallibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
will fall in the oven, stable affair as the oven
grating seems to be.</p>

<p>And again at meals, rite of a higher class,
solemn and mysterious. When Emmy Lou
must bow her head and shut her eyes&mdash;what
would happen if she basely peeked she hasn't
an idea&mdash;after which, Papa's "blessing" as
it is called, having been enunciated according
to rule, she may now reach out with intrepidity
and touch tumbler or spoon or biscuit.</p>

<p>So with prayer, highest rite of all, most
solemn and most mysterious. Prayer being
that potency of the impelling word again by
which Something known as God is to be propitiated,
and one protected from the fearful if
dimly sensed terrors of the dark when one
comes awake in the night.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou's Mamma, hitherto the never-failing
refuge from all that threatened, haven
of encircling sheltering arms and brooding
tender eyes, provided this protection for her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Emmy Lou before she went away and left her.
And more. She gave Emmy Lou to understand
that somewhere, if one grasped it aright,
was a person tenderly in league with Mamma
in loving Emmy Lou, and in desiring to comfort
her and protect her. A person named
Jesus. He was to be reached through prayer
too, and, like God in this also, through Sunday
school, this being a place around the corner
where one went with Georgie, the little boy
from next door.</p>

<p>These things being made clear, no wonder
that Mamma bade her Emmy Lou not to fail
to go to Sunday school, and never to forget to
say her prayers!</p>

<p>And no wonder that Emmy Lou quite earnestly
knew the rules for her prayers. That
it hurt her knees to get down upon them had
nothing to do with the case. The point with
which one has to do is that she does get down
on them. And being there, as now, steadied to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that position by the hand of Aunt Cordelia,
she shuts her eyes, as taught by Mamma,
though with no idea as to why, and folds her
hands, as taught by Mamma, with no understanding
as to why, and lowers her head, as
taught by Mamma, on Aunt Cordelia's knee.
And the rules being now all complied with, she
prays.</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou did not pray.</p>

<p>"Yes?" from Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>But still Emmy Lou failed to pray. Instead
her head lifted, and her eyes, opening,
showed themselves to be dilated by apprehension.
"Mamma starts it when it won't come,"
she faltered.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia endeavored to start it. "Now
I lay me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." she said with easy conviction.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, baby person, never had heard
of it. Terror crept into the eyes lifted to Aunt
Cordelia, as well as apprehension.</p>

<p>"Our Father .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." said Aunt Katie, coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
forward from the shadows. Emmy Lou's
attention seemed caught for the moment and
held.</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which art in Heaven," said Aunt
Katie.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou shook her head. She never had
heard of that either, though for a moment it
appeared as if she thought she had. A tear
rolled down.</p>

<p>"Go to bed and it will come to you tomorrow,"
from Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Say it in the morning instead," from Aunt
Katie.</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou shook her head, and clung
to Aunt Cordelia's knees when they would lift
her up.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia was worn out, herself. One
does not say good-bye to a loved sister, and
assume the care of a chubby, clinging baby
such as this one, without tax. "Whatever
is to be done about it?" she said to Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Katie despairingly. Then to Emmy Lou,
"Isn't there anything you know that will
do?"</p>

<p>There are varying rites, differing in their
nature as in their purpose, but each according
to its purpose inviolate and invincible.</p>

<p>"I know Georgia's count out?" said Emmy
Lou. "Eeny, meeny, miny, mo? Will that
do?"</p>

<p>But Aunt Cordelia, however sorely tempted,
could not bring herself, honest soul, to agree
that it would. Nor yet Aunt Katie.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise came tipping in and joined
them.</p>

<p>"I know Mary's cake count," said Emmy
Lou. "'One of butter, two of sugar, three of
flour, four eggs.' Will that do?"</p>

<p>Not even Aunt Louise could agree that it
would.</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie came tipping in.</p>

<p>"I know Papa's blessing," said Emmy Lou.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
"'We thank Thee, Lord, for this provision
of Thy bounty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?'"</p>

<p>"The very thing," said Uncle Charlie heartily.
"Set her up on her knees again, Cordelia,
and let her say it."</p>

<p>And Papa's blessing had served now, night
and morning, since, though it was evident to
those about her that Emmy Lou was both dubious
and uneasy.</p>

<p>The processes of the mind of an Emmy Lou,
however, if slow, are sound, if we know their
premises. There was yet another way by
which God could be propitiated, and Jesus,
who desired to love her and protect her,
reached. On the morning of her third day
with her aunties, she inquired about this.</p>

<p>"When is Sunday school?"</p>

<p>They told her. "Today is Saturday. Sunday
school is tomorrow."</p>

<p>She took this in. "Will I go to Sunday
school?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly you will go."</p>

<p>She took this in also. So far it was reassuring,
and she moved to the next point,
though nobody connected the two inquiries.
"There's a little boy next door?"</p>

<p>"Yes," from Aunt Katie, "a little boy with
dark and lovely eyes."</p>

<p>"A sweet and gentle little boy," from Aunt
Cordelia.</p>

<p>"A little boy named Izzy," from Aunt
Louise.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, looking from auntie to auntie
as each spoke, sighed deeply. The rules in
life, as she knew it, were holding good. As,
for example, was not Aunt Cordelia here for
Mamma? And Uncle Charlie for Papa? And
the substitute little white bed for her little
bed? And the substitute little armchair wherein
she was sitting at the moment, for her chair?</p>

<p>To be sure the details varied. Hitherto the
cook in the kitchen had been Mary, pink-cheeked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and pretty. Whereas now the cook
in the kitchen not only is round and rolling and
colored and named Aunt M'randy, but there
is a house-boy in the kitchen, too, whose name
is Bob. The stabilizing fact remains, however,
that there is a cook, and there is a
kitchen.</p>

<p>And now there is a little boy next door. <i>For
you to go to Sunday school with the little boy
next door</i>, holding tight to his hand, while his
Mamma at his door, and your Mamma at
your door, watch you down the street. That
he lords it over you, edicting each thing you
shall or shall not do along the way, is according
to immutable ruling also, as Georgie makes
clear, on the incontrovertible grounds that you
are the <i>littler</i>.</p>

<p>He has been to Sunday school too, before
you ever heard of it, as he lets you know, and
glories in his easy knowledge of the same.
And whereas you, on your very first Sunday,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
get there to learn that Cain killed Mabel, and
are visibly terrified at the fate of Mabel, according
to Georgie it is a mild event and nothing
to what Sunday school has to offer at its
best.</p>

<p>He knows the comportment of the place,
too, and at the proper moment drags Emmy
Lou to her knees with her face crushed to the
wooden bench beside his own. And later he
upbraids her that she fails in the fervor with
which he and everybody else, including the
lady who told Emmy Lou she was glad to see
her, pour forth a hum of words. When he
finds she does not know these words his scorn
is blighting. Though when she asks him to
teach them to her, it develops that he, the
mighty one, only knows a word here and there
to come in loud on himself.</p>

<p>For a moment, the other night, Emmy Lou
had fancied Aunt Katie was saying these
words used at Sunday school, but how could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
she be sure, seeing that she did not know them
herself?</p>

<p>And now there was a little boy next door
here! And Emmy Lou arose, her aunties having
gone about their Saturday morning affairs,
and seeking her little sacque with its scalloped
edge, which she pulled on, and her little round
hat which she carried by its elastic, went forth
into the warm comfort of the Indian Summer
morning to find him.</p>

<p>He was at his gate! The rule again!
Georgie was ever to be found even so at his
gate. Emmy Lou was shy, but not when she
knew what she had to do, and why. Opening
her gate and going out, paling by paling she
went along past her house and her yard, to the
little boy at the gate of his house and his yard.
When he saw her coming he even came to meet
her.</p>

<p>As her aunties had said, he was a dark-eyed
and lovely little boy. When she reached him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and put out her hand to his, he took it and led
her back to his gate with him. His name, she
remembered, was Izzy.</p>

<p>"Sunday school is tomorrow?" she said, looking
up at Izzy.</p>

<p>"Sunday school?" said Izzy.</p>

<p>"Where Cain killed Mabel?"</p>

<p>Izzy's dark eyes lit. He was a gentle and
kindly little boy. Emmy Lou felt she would
love Izzy. "We call it 'Temple.' But it is
today. My Mamma told me to walk ahead
and she would catch up with me."</p>

<p>"Today?"</p>

<p>Surely. With such visible proofs of it upon
Izzy. Do little boys wear velvet suits with
spotless collar and flamboyant tie but for occasions
such as Sunday school? Aunties and
even Mammas know less about Sunday school
than the Georgies and Izzys, who are authorities
since they are the ones who go. Emmy
Lou put on her little hat even to the elastic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Then her hand went into Izzy's again.</p>

<p>"I thought it was tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Izzy's face was alight as he took in her
meaning. She was going with <i>him</i>. His face
was alight as he led her along.</p>

<p>"It's 'round the corner?" she asked.</p>

<p>"'Round two corners," said Izzy. "How
did you know?"</p>

<p>A golden dome crowned this Sunday school,
and wide steps led high to great doors. They
waited at their foot, Izzy and Emmy Lou, a
dark-eyed little boy in a velvet suit, and a
blue-eyed little girl in a gingham dress and
scalloped sacque, while others went up and in,
old men, young men, old women, young
women, little boys, little girls. Waited until
Izzy's Mamma arrived and found him.</p>

<p>She was dark-eyed and lovely too. She listened
while he explained. Did a shadow, as
of patient sadness, cross her face?</p>

<p>"The little girl does not understand, Israel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
little son," she said. "Hold her hand carefully,
and take her back to her own gate. I
will wait for you here."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, bewildered as she was led along,
endeavored to understand.</p>

<p>"It isn't Sunday school?" she asked Izzy.</p>

<p>His face was no longer alight, only gentle
and, like his mother's, patient. "Not yours.
I thought it was. Mine and my mother's and
my father's."</p>

<p>Little girls left at their own gates, little girls
who have come to live at their aunties' home,
go around by the side way to the kitchen door.
Emmy Lou had learned that already. If anyone
had missed her there was no evidence of
it. Aunt M'randy, just emerging from this
kitchen door, a coal-bucket heaped with ashes
in her hand, as Emmy Lou arrived there,
paused in her rolling gait, and invited her to
go.</p>

<p>Where? Emmy Lou in her little sacque and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
her round hat hadn't an idea, but seeing that
she was expected to accept, took Aunt M'randy's
unoccupied hand and went.</p>

<p>And so it was that she found Sister. For
Aunt M'randy was going down the length of
the back yard, a nice yard with a tree and a
bush and what, palpably in a milder hour had
been flowers in a border, to the alley-gate to
empty the ashes. And beyond this alley gate,
outside which stood the barrel they were
seeking, in the alley itself, with the cottage
shanties of the alley world for background,
stood Sister! One knew she was Sister because
Aunt M'randy called her so.</p>

<p>Sister was small and brown and solid. Small
enough to be <i>littler</i> than Emmy Lou. Her
face was serious and her eyes in their setting
of generous white followed one wonderingly.</p>

<p><i>Littler</i> than Emmy Lou! The rule in life
was extending itself. Hitherto she, Emmy
Lou, had been that littler one, and hers the eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to follow wonderingly, and the effect of
meeting one thus littler than oneself is to experience
strange joys, palpably and patently
peculiar to being the larger.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou dropped the hand of Aunt
M'randy and went out into the alley and
straight to Sister.</p>

<p>Nor did Sister seem surprised at this, but
when Emmy Lou reached her and paused,
sidled closer, and her little brown hand crept
into Emmy Lou's white one and clung there.
Whereupon the white one, finding itself the
bigger, closed on the brown one and Emmy
Lou led Sister in through the alley gate, past
Aunt M'randy, and up through the yard with
its tree and its bush and its whilom flower
border.</p>

<p>More! There was a depression in the pavement
leading up to the house, a depression all
of the depth of about three of Emmy Lou's
fingers. Whereat she stopped, and putting her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
arms about Sister, solid for all she was a
baby thing, with straining and accession of
pink in the face, lifted her over! And the joy
of it was great! Emmy Lou never had met
one <i>littler</i> than herself before!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That evening at dusk, Aunt Louise came
in, brisk and animated. Her news was for
Aunt Cordelia and Aunt Katie, though certainly
Emmy Lou had a right to be interested.</p>

<p>"I met Molly Wright, the teacher of the
infant class at Sunday school," she said, "and
I stopped and told her that in the morning you
would send Emmy Lou around to her class.
That our house-boy would bring her."</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia had her ready the next morning
aforetime, red coat with triple capes, martial
hat and all, ready indeed before Bob, the
house-boy, had finished his breakfast.</p>

<p>The day was warm and sleepily sunny and
smiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may go outside and wait for Bob at
the gate if you like," Aunt Cordelia told
Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou had no idea of waiting at
any gate. Indecision with her was largely a
matter of not knowing what she was expected
to do. She knew in this case. By the time Bob
was ready and out looking for her, she had
been down through the alley gate and back,
bringing by the hand that person <i>littler</i> than
herself, Sister. Had led her through the front
gate and along to the next gate where Izzy
was standing.</p>

<p>Bob afterward explained his part vociferously
if lamely. But as Aunt M'randy said,
that was Bob.</p>

<p>"There they wuz, the three uv 'em, strung
erlong by the han's an' waitin' foh me. Seem
lak there warn't no call foh me to say nothin'
tell we got there."</p>

<p>"And then?" from Aunt Cordelia, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Aunt M'randy sniffed with skepticism.</p>

<p>"When we come to the infant class door
roun' on the side street like you tol' me, there
wuz a colored boy I know, drivin' a kerridge,
an' he called me. An' I tol' the chil'ren to
wait while I spoke to him. When I turned
roun' ag'in I saw 'em goin' in th'ough the doah.
An' I come home."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou in truth led them in. Give her
something that she knew to do, and she could
do it. Holding to the rule, Izzy was due to
be there because he was the larger, and Sister,
laconic little Sister, solid and brown, was due
to be there because, in the former likeness of
Emmy Lou, she was the <i>littler</i>.</p>

<p>One's place at Sunday school in company
with Georgie, has been the front bench. The
rule holds good, and Emmy Lou led the way
to the front bench now, where she and Izzy
lifted Sister to a place, then took their own
places either side of her. If the rest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
infant class already assembled were absorbed
in these movements, Emmy Lou did not notice
it, in that she was absorbed in them herself.</p>

<p>Miss Mollie Wright came in next, breezy
and brisk and a minute late, and in consequence
full of zeal and business.</p>

<p>Hitherto the rule has never varied. As
Emmy Lou knew Sunday school, the lady
teacher now says, "Good morning, children."
And these say, "Good morning," in return.</p>

<p>But the rule varied now. Miss Mollie
Wright coming around to the front before the
assembled class on its several benches, stopped,
looked, then full of sureness and business came
to Izzy and Emmy Lou and Sister, and took
Izzy by the hand.</p>

<p>"I doubt if your mother and father would
like it, Izzy," she said. "I think you had better
run home again. And this little girl next
to you doesn't belong here either." Miss Mollie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Wright was lifting Sister down. "I think
she had better run along as you go." And in
the very nicest way she started Izzy and Sister
toward the door. "What?" turning back to
the third little figure in a martial coat with
triple capes and a martial hat. "Why, are
you going, too?"</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia explained to Aunt Katie
and Aunt Louise and Uncle Charlie afterward.
"M'randy saw them when they reached
home and passed her kitchen window going
back through the yard, and came and told
me, and she and I went down to the alley
gate after them."</p>

<p>"What were they doing?" asked Aunt
Louise.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia answered as one completely
exasperated and outdone. "Sitting right down
on the ground there in the alley, in their Sunday
clothes, watching M'lissy, on her doorstep,
comb Letty's hair."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>True! Around M'lissy, the mother of Sister,
brown herself and kindly, with teeth that
flashed white with the smile of her there in the
sun, and Letty, the even <i>littler</i> sister of Sister,
firm planted on the lowest step, between
M'lissy's knees.</p>

<p>And bliss unspeakable as Izzy and Sister
and Emmy Lou in a circle on the ground
around the doorstep watched. For Letty's
head, by means of the comb in M'lissy's hand,
was being criss-crossed by partings into sections,
bi-sections, and quarter-sections, and
such hair as was integral to each wrapped with
string in semblance of a plait, plait after plait
succeeding one another over Letty's head. The
while M'lissy sang in a mounting, joyful
chant, interrupted by Letty's outcry now and
then beneath the vigor of the ministration.</p>

<p>"Ow-w, Mammy!"</p>

<p>The chant would hold itself momentarily for
a reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shet up," M'lissy would say.</p>

<p>Which would be too much even for laconic
Sister who from her place on the ground between
Izzy and Emmy Lou would defend
Letty. "When Mammy wrops yer h'ar, she
wrops hard."</p>

<p>After which the combing and the wrapping
and the chanting would go on again, M'lissy's
voice rising and falling in quaverings and
minors:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come to Jesus, come to Jesus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come to Jesus just now,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ju-u-st no-o-w co-o-me to-o Jesus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come to Jesus ju-u-st now."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Mamma's friend! In league with her in
loving Emmy Lou and desiring to comfort her
and protect her! Found not where she had
looked for Him at all but here with M'lissy in
the alley!</p>

<p>That night, according to rule, as Emmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Lou's head came through the opening of the
gown slipped over it, she said:</p>

<p>"Shall I say it now? Papa's blessing?"</p>

<p>And Aunt Cordelia, according to rule, sitting
down and steadying Emmy Lou to her
knees, waited.</p>

<p>What should have brought it back, Emmy
Lou's own little prayer as taught her by
Mamma? She only knew that it came of itself,
and that while her heart heaved and her breath
came hard, she stopped in the midst of Papa's
blessing, "We thank Thee, Lord, for this provision
of Thy bounty,&mdash;&mdash;" sobbed, caught
herself, opened her eyes and looked mutely at
Aunt Cordelia, closed them and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Look upon a little child;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pity my simplicity,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Suffer me to come to Thee."</span><br />

<h2>II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SHADES OF THE PRISON HOUSE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Papa</span> taking Mamma south, wherever that
may be, in search of health, whatever that may
be, carried a rough and wrinkled Father Bear
satchel. Mamma, pretty Mamma, taken
south in search of health, carried a soft and
smooth Mother Bear satchel. And since not
only do journeys demand satchels but analogies
must be made complete, Emmy Lou left
on the way in the keeping of her uncle and her
aunties was made happy by a Baby Bear
<i>papier-mach&eacute;</i> satchel, clamps, straps and all.
A satchel into which a nightgown could be
coaxed, her nightgown, since satchels demand
gowns, not to mention a pewter tea set put in
on her own initiative, provided she folded and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
refolded the gown with zeal before essaying
the attempt.</p>

<p>After Emmy Lou's establishment in the
new household, Aunt Cordelia proposed that
the satchel go to the attic where trunks and
satchels off duty belong. But Emmy Lou
would not hear to this. "Mamma's coming by
for me as she goes home, and I want it down
here so I can have it ready."</p>

<p>"And she gets it ready at least once a day,"
Aunt Cordelia told Uncle Charlie. "If she
doesn't wear her gowns out trying to put them
in it, she will the satchel. However, since she
heard that her mother lived in this house when
she was a little girl named Emily, I've had
no further trouble with her, that is, trouble of
a kind. How does one go about a child's religious
training, Charlie?"</p>

<p>But to Emmy Lou, Aunt Cordelia knew
all about God and heaven. At her bidding she
learned a hymn, a pretty text, another prayer.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/ill-050.jpg" width="305" height="500" alt="&quot;&#39;When I turned roan&#39; ag&#39;in I saw &#39;em goin&#39; in th&#39;ough the doah.&#39;&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;When I turned roan&#39; ag&#39;in I saw &#39;em goin&#39; in th&#39;ough the doah.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"For we must learn a little more about God
and Heaven every day along the way," Aunt
Cordelia said.</p>

<p>With Emmy Lou at bedtime in her lap, a
blanket wrapped about her gown, the fire flickering,
Aunt Cordelia, to help her get to sleep,
sang about Heaven.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Thy gardens and thy goodly walks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Continually are green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where grow such sweet and pleasant flowers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As nowhere else are seen&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Asleep?" from Aunt Cordelia. "No?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou in Aunt Cordelia's lap was
amazed to hear these things. "Thy gardens
and Thy goodly walks!" Hitherto she had
been afraid of heaven! And afraid of God!</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia hearing about it was shocked.
Truly shocked and no less dismayed at how
to remedy it, if Emmy Lou had but known it.</p>

<p>"Afraid of God? Why, Emmy Lou! He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
is our Father to go to, just as you run to meet
Papa." Aunt Cordelia, gaining heart, took
fresh courage. "God is everybody's Father,
just as Heaven is our home."</p>

<p>The Aunt Cordelias may generalize, but
the Emmy Lous will particularize.</p>

<p>"Izzy's father? And Sister's father? And
Minnie's?"</p>

<p>Israel Judah lived next door, little colored
Sister lived in the alley, and Minnie lived with
the lady next door to Izzy.</p>

<p>"Their Father, and yours and mine and
everyone's. Don't you think you can go to
sleep now?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was positive she could not. God,
of whom she had been afraid, is our Father!</p>

<p>Next door to Emmy Lou, at Izzy's, lives
an old, old man. His brows are white and his
beard falls on his breast. He smiles on Emmy
Lou when she goes to his knee to speak to
him, but he draws Izzy to him and kisses him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Aunt Katie calls him beautiful. Uncle Charlie
calls him a glorious old patriarch. But Izzy's
Mamma calls him <i>father</i>.</p>

<p>And suddenly to Emmy Lou, there in Aunt
Cordelia's lap, God is a Person! He paces
his goodly walks, as Papa does the flagging
from the gate to the house with Emmy Lou
running to meet him. God paces his walks between
his sweet and pleasant flowers and his
brows are white and his beard falls on his
breast. Will he smile on Emmy Lou? And
on Izzy and Sister and Minnie? Or will he
draw them to him and kiss them?</p>

<p>"And at last she went to sleep," Aunt
Cordelia, coming downstairs, told Uncle
Charlie.</p>

<p>Straight from the breakfast table the next
morning, Emmy Lou went and brought her
cloak.</p>

<p>"Izzy will be waiting for me at his gate," she
told Aunt Cordelia. The custom being for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the two meeting at Izzy's gate then to go to
the alley hunting Sister.</p>

<p>Aunt Katie came downstairs just here, looking
for Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"Do you know where my scissors are? I
can't find mine or any others."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou has a way of hunting scissors
for herself and Sister to cut out pictures,
but is quite sure this time that she is not
culpable.</p>

<p>"I ain't had nary pair," she assured Aunt
Katie.</p>

<p>Aunt Katie, apparently forgetting the scissors,
swept round on Aunt Cordelia who was
just leaving the breakfast table.</p>

<p>"There!" she said accusingly.</p>

<p>"There!" echoed Aunt Louise, still in the
dining-room, too. "We told you she would
be picking up such things in the alley!"</p>

<p>"Emmy Lou," expostulated Aunt Cordelia,
"you didn't mean to say, 'I ain't had nary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
pair.' You know better. Think hard and see
if you can't say it right."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, the cloak she had brought half
on, thought hard. "I ain't had ary pair," she
said.</p>

<p>Aunt Katie spoke positively. "I don't think
you ought to let her play so much with Sister.
Louise and I have said so right along."</p>

<p>Not play with Sister! Emmy Lou was
astounded. She loved Sister, smaller than herself!
She turned to Aunt Cordelia for corroboration.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia was troubled. "Come to me,
Emmy Lou, and let me put your cloak on you,
and tie your hood. If she were going to be
here all the time it would be different," this to
Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise. Then to
Emmy Lou, "Suppose today you stay next
door and play with Izzy?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was amazed. "And Minnie?"
she asked. "Mayn't I play with Minnie?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"She means the little girl who works
for Mrs. Noble," explained Aunt Cordelia
quietly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Noble is from over the river," said
Aunt Louise in tones which, however one may
wonder what the river has to do with it, disqualify
this lady at once. "She speaks of the
child as a little hired girl."</p>

<p>"Emmy Lou," said Aunt Katie, "remember
that this side of the Ohio we have servants, not
hired girls."</p>

<p>"But she must not call the little girl a servant,
Katie," said Aunt Cordelia. "I won't
have her hurting the child's feelings, whatever
she is."</p>

<p>"I call her Minnie," said Emmy Lou, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Certainly you do," said Aunt Cordelia, and
kissed her.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise defended Aunt Katie. "While
the child is hardly to be held responsible, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
has ways, as well as Sister, we certainly do not
want Emmy Lou to imitate."</p>

<p>Ways? Minnie? Marvelous, inexhaustible
Minnie? Certainly she has ways, ways that
draw one, that hold one. Were Aunt Louise
and Aunt Katie casting doubts on Minnie?
As they had on Sister? Emmy Lou in cloak
and hood looked to Aunt Cordelia for corroboration.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia looked worried, "Just as she
is beginning to be a little happier, I wish,
Louise, you and Katie could let the child
alone."</p>

<p>"But Minnie?" Emmy Lou wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. Run along out, now,
and play."</p>

<p>A sunny winter day it was as Emmy Lou
went, a day to rejoice in, could one at four
put the feelings into thought, except that
Izzy at his gate in his stout coat and his fur
cap is only mildly glad to see her. Izzy is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
six years old. Usually kind, and as patient
to catch her point as to help her to his, just
now he is engrossed with looking down the
street.</p>

<p>Without turning, he does, however, confide
in her. "Minnie has just gone by to the grocery!"</p>

<p>If Emmy Lou had been disposed to be hurt,
she understood now! Minnie having gone by
to the grocery would be <i>back!</i></p>

<p>They have known her to speak to now for
a week. She stopped one day at Izzy's gate
when he and Emmy Lou and Sister were
standing there. Her plaits were tied with bits
of calico and there was a smudge on her wrist;
under her arm was a paper bag and in her hand
a bucket. She swept the three of them, Izzy,
Emmy Lou, and Sister, up and down with her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You go to synagogue," she told Izzy. "An'
your mother's gone away sick an' left you,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
she said to Emmy Lou. Then she turned to
Sister.</p>

<p>"Nigger," she said.</p>

<p>But Sister was what she afterward explained
as "ready for her." She had met Minnie before,
so it proved, and M'lissy, her mother, had
her ready if she ever met her again. For all
she was a little thing, Sister swept Minnie up
and down with <i>her</i> eyes.</p>

<p>"Po' white," she said.</p>

<p>Which, while meaningless to some&mdash;Emmy
Lou and Izzy for example&mdash;brought the angry
red to Minnie's cheek.</p>

<p>This was a week ago. Since then Minnie
had come out on the pavement twice and joined
Emmy Lou and Izzy at play.</p>

<p>Wonderful Minnie! At once instigator and
leader, arbiter and propounder. Why? Because
she knew. Knew what? Knew everything.
About the devil who would come right
up out of the ground if you stamped three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
times and said his name. Though from what
Emmy Lou had heard about him at Sunday
school, and Izzy knew from some boys down
at the corner, one wondered that any would
incur the risk by doing either.</p>

<p>And Minnie knew about gypsies who steal
little boys and girls out of their beds! Izzy is
six, and Emmy Lou is four, and Minnie is
ten going on eleven; can it be wondered that
they looked up to her?</p>

<p>She speaks darkly about herself. She has
brothers and sisters better off than she is, somewhere,
who don't want to speak to her when
she meets them on the street!</p>

<p>And she speaks darkly about the lady she
lives with whom she calls Mis' Snoble. "When
Lisa Schmit from the grocery came to play
with me, she shoo'd her off with the broom,"
she said.</p>

<p>Only yesterday she appeared at her gate for
a brief moment to say she could not come out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and play. "Mis' Snoble's feelin' right up to
the mark today; we're goin' to beat rugs an'
wash winders."</p>

<p>But this morning as she pauses on her way
home from the grocery, her communication to
Izzy and Emmy Lou at Izzy's gate is of different
import. "Mis' Snoble's not feelin' up
to the mark today. Come in with me an' ask
her an' maybe she'll let me come an' play."</p>

<p>Go in with Minnie! To Mrs. Noble! Emmy
Lou's hand went into Izzy's, as she for one
gazed at Minnie appalled!</p>

<p>Yet Minnie's face is eager and her eyes implore.
Her plaits are tied with calico, and her
face behind its eagerness is thin. Izzy looses
Emmy Lou's hand, even as she draws it away,
and, behold, his hand now is in one of Minnie's,
and Emmy Lou's is in the other. They
are going with her to ask Mrs. Noble.</p>

<p>Through Minnie's gate, around by the side
pavement, in at the kitchen door, through a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
hall and to another door. Mrs. Noble has not
appeared yet with her broom to shoo them
away, but she might!</p>

<p>Minnie pushed this door open and led the
way in&mdash;wonderful, brave Minnie!&mdash;but Izzy
and Emmy Lou paused in the doorway.</p>

<p>Mrs. Noble, spare and upright in her chair,
crocheting, looked up. Her eyes, having swept
up and down Minnie, traveled on to Emmy
Lou and Izzy, then returned coldly, as it were,
to her work.</p>

<p>"Kitchen's red up," from Minnie eagerly
and hopefully in what one supposed must be
the language of over the river; "been to the
grocery, an' the sink's clean."</p>

<p>If Mrs. Noble heard this she was above betraying
it.</p>

<p>"Fire's laid in the stove, but not lit."</p>

<p>Never a sign.</p>

<p>"Potatoes peeled an' in the saucepan waitin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Noble looked up. "One half-hour, or
maybe three-quarters till I call."</p>

<p>And they were gone, Minnie first like a
flash, Izzy next, no loiterer in the house of Mrs.
Noble himself if he could help it and only the
slower-paced because somebody had to wait for
Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>More wonderful day than it had been earlier,
sunnier and less frosty. Minnie, whose wrap
is disturbingly nearer a sacque than a coat in
its scant nature, takes her place on the horse-block
at the curb before Izzy's house, and he
and Emmy Lou take places either side of her.</p>

<p>Minnie, wonderful Minnie, ten years old and
over, knows it all. What, for instance? Everything,
anything. Such as this matter she
brings up now of brothers and sisters. They
are a bad lot. She says so. A sort to stop at
nothing even to passing a poorer sister without
knowing her on the street! As she went
to the grocery with her bucket and oil-can just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
now, her brother passed <i>her</i> on the street.
Minnie heard once of a man. When she takes
this tone the time has come to draw closer.
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O'Rouke was this man's name. He was
rich and g-r-rand. So grand <i>he</i> didn't know
<i>his</i> own brothers when he met them on the
street. An' his brothers made up their minds
they would go to his house an' hide theirselves
an' watch him when he counted his money. It
was a g-r-rand house. Over the mantelpiece
was a picture of his dead mother. Over the
piano was a picture of his dead father. Over
the what-not was a picture of his wife. Over
the sofa was a picture of hisself. An' his four
brothers came to hide theirselves an' watch him
count his money. The room was dark in all the
corners. An' one brother clumb up on the
mantelpiece an' hid hisself behind the picture
of his mother, an' cut holes th'ough the eyes so
his eyes r-o-olling could look th'ough. An' the
next brother clumb up on the piano an' hid hisself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
behind the picture of his father an' cut
holes th'ough the eyes so his eyes r-o-olling
could look th'ough. An' the next brother
clumb up on the what-not an' hid hisself behind
the picture of the wife an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sister appeared around the side of Izzy's
house and came through the gate. Even
though her finger <i>was</i> in her mouth, when she
saw Minnie she looked provocative.</p>

<p>"Go on with the brothers, Minnie," begged
Izzy.</p>

<p>"Go on, Minnie," begged Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>But Minnie had no idea of resuming the
brothers. Nobody, it would seem, could look
provocative with impunity at her!</p>

<p>"Nigger," she said to Sister.</p>

<p>But M'lissy, the mother of Sister, had her
ready again. Did she send her around here
for the purpose?</p>

<p>"Po' white," said Sister, taking her finger
out of her mouth. "An' worser. My mammy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
said to tell you so. You're a <i>n'orphan</i>."</p>

<p>The solid ground of the accustomed gave
way. Confusion followed. Minnie, hitherto
the ready, the able, having sprung up to meet
Sister's onslaught, whatever it was to be, sank
back on the horse-block, and hiding her face in
her arms, cried, and more, at touch of the
quickly solicitous arms of Izzy and Emmy
Lou about her, she sobbed.</p>

<p>Whereupon Emmy Lou arose, Emmy Lou
in her stout little coat and her hood and her
mittens; and looking about her on the ground,
found a switch full seven inches long, and with
it drove Sister, little Sister, away, quite away.
Had not Emmy Lou's own aunties cast the
initial doubt on Sister anyway?</p>

<p>Then she came back to the horse-block.
"What's a n'orphan, Minnie?" Izzy was asking.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou wanted to know this very thing.</p>

<p>"It's livin' with Mis' Snoble an' wearin' her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
shoes when they're too big for you," sobbed
Minnie. "'Tain't as if anybody would be one
if they could help theirselves."</p>

<p>"What makes you a n'orphan, then, Minnie,
if you don't want to be one?" from Izzy.</p>

<p>"You're a n'orphan when <i>your mother goes
to Heaven an' leaves you</i> an' forgets you," bitterly.</p>

<p>Heaven? God paces his goodly walks there,
between his sweet and pleasant flowers. But
would your mother <i>leave you to go there?</i> And
going, <i>forget you?</i></p>

<p>A window went up and Izzy's mamma appeared.</p>

<p>"Israel," she called, "run in to the porch and
give grandpa his cane and help him start into
the house. It's growing chill."</p>

<p>Minnie on the horse-block flung up her head
and wiped away the tears. "That old man
again!" she said.</p>

<p>Did Minnie have ways? Ways that Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Katie and Aunt Louise did not want their
Emmy Lou to imitate? Was this one of her
ways?</p>

<p>For Izzy's grandpa of whom Minnie spoke
disparagingly was he of the white brows and
the flowing beard. On days such as this they
helped him to the porch where he sat bundled
in a chair in the sun, his cane beside him.</p>

<p>Except when this cane was not, which was
the trouble as Minnie saw it. For Izzy's
grandpa was forever letting his cane slide to
the floor, yet could not get up, or down, or
about, without it.</p>

<p>Izzy ran in now. He was affectionate and
dutiful. Aunt Cordelia said so. And having
put the cane in his grandfather's hand, though
not without several efforts at keeping it there,
at which his grandfather, slowly&mdash;Oh, so slowly
this morning!&mdash;and with trembling effort,
drew him to him and kissed him, he came back.</p>

<p>"Why <i>did</i> your mother go to Heaven and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
leave you and forget you, Minnie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Heaven's a better place than this, if what
they tell about it's true," bitterly. "<i>I ain't
blamin' her for goin'</i>, myself."</p>

<p>"Izzy," came the call in a few moments
again. "Did you tell grandpa to come in?"</p>

<p>Izzy went running, for when he turned to
look, the cane had slipped from his grandfather's
hand again and rolled to the foot of
the steps, and his head above the snowy beard
was fallen on his breast. Nor would he in this
world lift it again, though none of the three
grasped this.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia was decided at the breakfast
table the next morning.</p>

<p>"They will not want you next door with
Izzy today," she told Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"Mayn't he come here?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if his mother will want him to come
today."</p>

<p>The day following, however, Aunt Cordelia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and Aunt Katie went next door from the
breakfast table and when they came back they
brought Izzy with them, not <i>for a while</i>, but
<i>for the day</i>. His dark eyes were troubled
and his cheeks were pale. He was
kindly and affectionate. Aunt Cordelia said
so.</p>

<p>And Aunt Cordelia agreed that after dinner
Bob could ask Mrs. Noble to let Minnie
come over.</p>

<p>"How can you, Sister Cordelia?" expostulated
Aunt Louise. "A little servant girl!"</p>

<p>Bob came back with Minnie. "For a nour,"
she said as she arrived. "I can stay until the
pork-house whistle blows for four."</p>

<p>She waited until Aunt Cordelia, having settled
them in the sunny back room, went out
the door.</p>

<p>"What's happened to your gran'pa?" then
she said to Izzy. Did she say it not as if she
did not know, but as if she did?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's gone to sleep," said Izzy. "He won't
be sick or tired any more."</p>

<p>"Sleep?" from Minnie. "Haven't they told
you yet? We watched 'em start, Bob and I,
before we came in."</p>

<p>Start? Start where? Izzy's eyes, already
troubled, were big and startled now. "Where's
grandpa going? Where's my grandpa going?"</p>

<p>Did Minnie in some way imply that she
knew more than she meant to tell? "To
Heaven," virtuously. "I've told you about
it. That's why he won't be sick or tired any
more. You ought to be glad. Here!" with
quick change in tone. "Where you going?
What's the matter with you now? You can't
keep him back if you try!"</p>

<p>But Izzy was gone. Nor when Minnie, who
was nothing but a little servant girl after all,
for Aunt Louise said so, ran after him, did he
pause; only called back as he hurried down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the stairs. He was a dutiful little boy, Aunt
Cordelia said so.</p>

<p>"If Grandpa has to go he'll need his cane.
He can't get anywhere without his cane."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Emmy Lou, coming in through the kitchen
from play, a week later, met Uncle Charlie
in the hall just arriving by the front door.</p>

<p>He neither spoke to her nor saw her as he
overtook her on the lowest stair, but pushed
by and hurried up.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou's heart swelled. It was not like
Uncle Charlie. She clambered the curving
flight after him. He had gone ahead into
Aunt Cordelia's room and she, on her way
there herself, trudged after.</p>

<p>What did it mean? Why did it frighten
her? Aunt Katie, Aunt Louise, weeping? Uncle
Charlie now beside the fireplace, bowed
against its shelf? This bit of yellow paper at
his feet on the floor?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia, weeping herself, would
know. "What is it?" faltered Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia knew and held out her arms
to the call. No evasions now; truth for Emmy
Lou.</p>

<p>"Mamma will not be back. She has gone
ahead to Heaven. Come to Aunt Cordelia
and let her comfort you, precious baby."</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou, still in her coat and hat, did
not come; she did not pause to dally. She hurried
past the various hands outstretched to
stay her, to her own little room adjoining.</p>

<p>Complete her <i>papier-mach&eacute;</i> satchel was,
even to its clamps and straps, sitting beside
her bed ready, her satchel which would hold
a gown, and other treasure such as pewter
dishes could she stop for such now. She
dragged at a drawer of her own bureau.</p>

<p>"What in the world&mdash;&mdash;?" from Aunt Cordelia,
who had followed.</p>

<p>"What are you doing&mdash;&mdash;?" from Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Katie and Aunt Louise, who had followed
Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou knew exactly what she was doing.
Izzy had known too when he went hurrying
after. Minnie in her time, had she known,
might have gone hurrying too. A nightgown,
at her pull, trailed from the open drawer.</p>

<p>Yet what was there in the faces about her
to disturb her? To make her loose her hold on
the gown, look from one to the other of them
and falter? Uncle Charlie, too, had come into
the room now.</p>

<p>Were they casting doubts again? As they
cast them on Sister who until then had in truth
been a little sister? As they cast them on Minnie
who until then had been neither hired girl
nor servant, but Minnie? Emmy Lou turned
to Aunt Cordelia for corroboration.</p>

<p>Even as she looked, she knew. We must
learn a little more each day along the way,
even as Aunt Cordelia had said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The nightgown trailing from her hand fell
limply. The satchel, relinquished, rolled along
the floor. Those goodly walks receded, their
sweet and pleasant flowers drooped their listless
heads. Emmy Lou, nearing five years old,
was a step further from heaven.</p>

<p>"How shall we teach a little child?" said
Aunt Cordelia, weeping.</p>

<p>"How indeed?" said Uncle Charlie.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A FEW STRONG INSTINCTS AND A FEW PLAIN RULES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> exigency in life save one, for an
Emmy Lou at six, seemingly is provided for
by rules or admonition, the one which sometimes
is overlooked being lack of understanding.</p>

<p>"'Take heed that thou no murder do,'" was
the new clause of the Commandments In
Verse, she had recited at Sunday school only
yesterday.</p>

<p>"'The way of the transgressor is hard,'"
said Dr. Angell from his pulpit to her down
in the pew between Uncle Charlie and Aunt
Cordelia an hour later. Or she took it that he
was saying it to her. For while one frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fails to follow the words in this thing of admonition,
there is no mistaking the manner.
When she came into church with Uncle Charlie
and Aunt Cordelia, in her white piqu&eacute; coat
and her leghorn hat, Dr. Angell had met her
in the aisle and seemed glad to see her, even to
patting her cheek, but once he was in his pulpit
he shook an admonishing finger at her and
thundered.</p>

<p>Nor did Emmy Lou, a big girl now for all
she still was pink-cheeked and chubby, lack for
admonitions at home from Aunt Cordelia and
Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise above stairs, and
Aunt M'randy in the kitchen below&mdash;a world
of aunts, in this respect, it might have seemed,
had Emmy Lou, faithful to those she deemed
faithful to her, been one to think such
things.</p>

<p>Admonitions vary. Aunt Cordelia and
Aunt M'randy drew theirs from the heart, so
to put it. "When you mind what I say, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
are a good little girl. When you do not mind
what I say, you are a bad little girl," said Aunt
Cordelia.</p>

<p>"When I tell you to go on upstairs outer my
way, I want you to go. When I tell you to
take your fingers outen thet dough, I want you
to take 'em out," said Aunt M'randy. Admonitions
put in this way are entirely comprehensible.
There is no getting away from
understanding mandates such as these.</p>

<p>Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise drew their admonitions
from a small, battered book given
to them when they were little for their guidance
and known as "Songs for the Little Ones
at Home."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O that it were my chief delight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To do the thing I ought;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then let me try with all my might,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To mind what I am taught,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Aunt Katie.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"O dear me, Emma, how is this?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your hands are very dirty, Miss;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I don't expect such hands to see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When you come in to dine with me,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Aunt Louise.</div>

<p>Nor did Emmy Lou suspect that it was because
their advice did not come from the heart
it reduced her to gloom; that Aunt Katie and
Aunt Louise delighted in it not because it was
advice, but because it did reduce her to gloom;
that Aunt Katie, who was twenty-two, and
Aunt Louise, who was twenty, did it to tease?</p>

<p>Bob, the house-boy, too, had his line of
ethics for her. And while he went to Sunday
school, and to what he called Lodge, and had
what he termed fun'ral insurance, observances
all entitling him to standing, he pointed his
warnings with dim survivals from an older,
darker lore which someone wiser than Bob
or Emmy Lou might have recognized as hoodoo.
Not that Bob or Emmy Lou either knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
this. Nor yet did Emmy Lou grasp that he
to whom she was told to go for company a
dozen times a day when the others wanted to
get rid of her used the same to get rid of her
himself. On the contrary, her faith in him
being what it was, his warnings sank deep, the
dire fates of his examples being guaranty for
that. Moreover his examples came close home.</p>

<p>The little girl who wouldn't go play when
they wanted to get rid of her. The little boy
who would stay out visiting so late they had
to send the house-boy after him. The little
girl who wouldn't go 'long when told to go,
but would hang around the kitchen. Treated
as a class by Bob, a class, so his gloomy head-shakings
would imply, peculiarly fitting to his
present company, their fates were largely similar.</p>

<p>"They begun to peak, an' then to pine. An'
still they wouldn't mind. Thar ha'r drapped
out in the comb. An' still they wouldn't mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Thar nails come loose. An' still they wouldn't
mind. Thar teeth drapped out. But it wuz
too late. When they tried to mind <i>they
couldn't mind!</i>"</p>

<p>And while his audience might chafe beneath
the almost too personal tone of these remarks,
she dared not question them. Examples dire
as Bob's were vouched for every day. Only
the Noahs were saved in the ark. Lot's wife
turned to a pillar of salt. The bear came out
of the woods and ate the naughty children.
Aunt Cordelia and Sunday school alike said
so. The wicked sisters of Cinderella were
driven out of the palace. Aunt Katie and
Aunt Louise said so. The disobedient little
mermaid was turned into foam. The little
girl down at the corner, named Maud, who
owned the book, said so.</p>

<p>These things all considered, perhaps it came
to be a matter of too many and cumulative admonishings
with Emmy Lou. Nature will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
revolt at too steady a diet perhaps even of admonitions.
Or it may be that even an Emmy
Lou in time rebels, when elders so persistently
refuse to recognize that there is another, an
Emmy Lou's side, to most affairs.</p>

<p>For at six the peripatetic instinct has awakened
and the urge within is to move on.
Where? How does an Emmy Lou know?
Anywhere so that the cloying performances
of outgrown baby ways are behind her.</p>

<p>Many whom she knew in the receded stages
of five years old, and four, have moved on or
away before this. Izzy who lived next door.
Minnie who lived next to Izzy. Lisa Schmit
whose father had the grocery at the corner but
now has one at a corner farther away.</p>

<p>And others have moved into Emmy Lou's
present ken. Mr. Dawkins has the grocery
at the corner now, and his little girl is Maud,
guarantor for the mermaid, and his big girl
is Sarah, and his little boy is Albert Eddie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
The peripatetic instinct impelling, Emmy
Lou goes to see them as often as Aunt Cordelia
will permit.</p>

<p>There is fascination in going if one could
but convey this to Aunt Cordelia in words.
Any can live in houses; indeed most people
do; or in Emmy Lou's time did; but only the
few live over a grocery.</p>

<p>It argues these different. Mr. Schmit was
German. Mr. Dawkins is English. At Emmy
Lou's, the teakettle, a vague part in family
affairs, boils on the stove, but at Maud's, the
teakettle, a family affair of moment, boils on
the "hob," which is to say, the grate. And
more, the father and mother of Maud and Albert
Eddie not only have crossed that vague
something, home of the little mermaid, the
ocean, but their mother has all but seen the
Queen.</p>

<p>"You know the Queen?" the two had asked
Emmy Lou anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>And she had said yes. And she did know
her. Knew her from long association and by
heart. She sat in her parlor at the bottom of
the page, eating bread and honey, while the
maid and the blackbird were at the top of the
next page.</p>

<p>"Tell her about it," Maud and Albert Eddie
then had urged Sarah, their elder sister,
"about when mother all but saw the Queen?"</p>

<p>Sarah complied. "'Now hurry along home
with your brother in the perambulator while I
stop at the shop,' mother's mother said to her.
Mother was twelve years old. But she didn't
hurry. She stopped to watch every one else
all at once hurrying and running, and so when
she reached the corner the Queen, for the
Queen it was, had gone by."</p>

<p>"If she had minded her mother&mdash;&mdash;" from
Albert Eddie.</p>

<p>"And hurried on home with the perambulator&mdash;&mdash;"
from Maud. Proof not only of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
worthy attitude on their part towards the admonition
of the tale, but of an evident comprehension
of what a perambulator was.</p>

<p>But Aunt Cordelia, not always a free agent,
was no longer permitting so much visiting.</p>

<p>"You are letting her actually live on the
street," said Aunt Katie.</p>

<p>"With any sort of children," supplemented
Aunt Louise.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Aunt Cordelia came the nearest
to understanding there is another side to
these affairs. "Sometimes I think she's lonesome,"
she said.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Those children who are all the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Allowed to wander out,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And only waste their time in play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or running wild about&mdash;&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Aunt Katie. Aunt Louise finished it:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Who do not any school attend,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But trifle as they will,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Are almost certain in the end,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To come to something ill."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And while it almost would seem that Aunt
Cordelia was being admonished too, and from
the little book, in the light of what followed,
it appeared that Aunt Katie, Aunt Louise, and
the little book were right.</p>

<p>The day in question started wrong. In the
act of getting out of bed, life seemed a heavy
and a listless thing. If Emmy Lou, less pink-cheeked
than usual if any had chanced to notice,
but full as chubby, ever had felt this way
before, she would have told Aunt Cordelia that
her head ached. But if the head never has
ached before?</p>

<p>Her attention was distracted here, anyhow,
and she, startled, let her tongue pass along
the row of her teeth. Milk teeth, those who
knew the term would have called them. There
is much, however, that an Emmy Lou, one
small person in a household of elders, is supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to know that she does not, knowledge
coming not by nature but through understanding.</p>

<p>Then, reassured, her attention came back to
the affairs of the moment, the chief of these
being that life is a heavy and listless affair and
the labyrinthine windings of stockings more
than ever fretting in effect upon the temper.
And after stockings come garments, ending
with the pink calico dress apportioned to the
day, and succeeding garments come buttons.
Aunt Katie in the next room was cheerful.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I love to see a little girl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Rise with the lark so bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bathe, comb and dress with cheerful face&mdash;&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>One was in no mood whatever for the little
book, and showed it. Aunt Louise in the
next room too, possibly grasped this.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Why is Sarah standing there<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Leaning down upon a chair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With such an angry lip and brow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wonder what's the matter now?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Aunt Cordelia was struggling with the buttons.
"Let her alone, both of you. Sometimes
I think you are half responsible."</p>

<p>The outrages of the day went on at breakfast.
Emmy Lou's once prized highchair, a
tight fit now, and which, could she have had
her own way, would have been repudiated some
time ago, was in itself provocative. She
climbed into it stonily.</p>

<p>Bob placed a saucer before her. If she ever
had suffered the qualms of an uneasy stomach
before, she would have known and told Aunt
Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I don't want my oatmeal," said Emmy
Lou.</p>

<p>"You must eat it before you can have anything
else," said Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I don't want anything else."</p>

<p>"She's fretful," said Aunt Katie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's cross," said Aunt Louise.</p>

<p>"I am coming to think you are right, Louise,"
said Aunt Cordelia. "What she needs
is to be at school with other children. School
opens the day after tomorrow, and I'll start
her."</p>

<p>"This baby?" from Uncle Charlie incredulously,
his gaze seeking Emmy Lou in her
highchair.</p>

<p>"Look at that oatmeal still untouched," from
Aunt Cordelia. "Charlie, <i>she is getting so she
doesn't want to mind!</i>"</p>

<p>The outrages went on during the morning.
Emmy Lou did not know what to do with herself,
whereas Aunt Cordelia had a great deal
to do with herself. "You little hindering
thing!" by and by from that person with exasperation.
"Go on out and talk with Bob.
He's cleaning knives on the kitchen doorstep."</p>

<p>But Bob, occupied with his board and bath-brick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and piece of raw potato, had no idea of
talking with her. He talked to himself.</p>

<p>"Seems like I done forgot how it went, 'bout
thet li'l boy whut would stan' roun' listenin'.
Some'n' like 'bout thet li'l girl whut wouldn't
go about her business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gathering up his knives and board, he went
in to set his table. Turning around by and by
he found her behind him in the pantry. He
talked to himself some more.</p>

<p>"Reckon is I done forgot how it went?
'Bout thet li'l girl got shet up in the pantry
after they tol' her to keep out? She knowed
ef she coughed they'd hear an' come an' fin'
her thar. An' she hed to cough. An' she
wouldn't cough. An' she hed to. An' she
wouldn't. An' she hed to. An' she DID.
But it wuz too late. The pieces of her wuz
ev'ey whar, even to the next spring when they
wuz house-cleanin', an' foun' her knuckle-bone
on the fur top shelf. Looks lak to me, somebody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
else is gettin' ready for a good lesson.
Better watch out."</p>

<p>The final outrage was yet to come. At the
close of dinner Emmy Lou came round to
Aunt Cordelia's chair. Aunt Cordelia was
worn out. She had never known her Emmy
Lou to behave as she had in the last day or so.</p>

<p>"Now don't come asking me again," she
said, forestalling the issue. "I've gone over
the matter with you several times before today.
You cannot go play with anybody. No,
not with Maud at the corner or anybody else."
Then to Uncle Charlie, shaking his head over
this unwonted friction as he rose to start back
down town: "They tell me there is whooping-cough
around everywhere, Charlie." Then to
Emmy Lou: "Now try and be a good girl
for the rest of the day, Aunt Cordelia will
have her hands full. It is Bob's afternoon out.
Try and be Aunt Cordelia's precious baby."</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou, her tongue traveling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
row of her teeth anew, didn't propose to be
anybody's precious baby. She was a big girl,
now, almost six years old, and wanted it recognized
that she was. And she didn't feel good
in the least, but like being quite the reverse for
the rest of the day.</p>

<p>This was at two o'clock. At three Aunt
Cordelia's own Emmy Lou, the pink calico
upon her person and a straw hat upon her
head, turned the knob of the front door. Having
obeyed thus far in life, she was about to
disobey.</p>

<p>The front door, its knob requiring both
hands and her tiptoes, whereas the kitchen door
would have been open. But Aunt M'randy
was in the kitchen.</p>

<p>As it chanced, Bob was leaving by the
kitchen door, and coming around by the side
pavement as Emmy Lou came down the steps,
they met. His idea seemed to be that she was
tagging after him, an injury in itself when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
she divined it. He was of the same mind evidently
when a moment later she was still beside
him outside the gate.</p>

<p>He paused and addressed the air disparagingly
before he went. "Looks like to me I'll
have to bresh up my ricollection 'bout thet li'l
girl whut would come outside her own gate
after she was tole not to come. Spoilin' for
one good lesson, thet li'l girl wuz, an' 'pears
like to me she got it. Better watch out." And
Bob was gone, up the street, whereas it was
the definite intention of the other person at
that gate to go down the street.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawkins' grocery fronted on the main
street while his housedoor opened on the side-street.
A few moments later a small figure in
a familiar pink dress and straw hat reached
this side door, and, pausing long enough for
her tongue to pass uneasily along the row of
her teeth, opened it upon a flight of stairs and
went in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Five o'clock it was and after when Mr.
Dawkins' eldest daughter Sarah, followed by
Maud and Albert Eddie, came down these
steps propelling a visitor in a pink dress and
straw hat, a visitor known from the Dawkins'
viewpoint as that little girl from up the street
in the white house that get their groceries
from Schmit.</p>

<p>Perhaps this fact explained Sarah's small
patience with this person who in herself would
seem to invite it. She not only was pale, and
her lips pressed with unnatural while miserable
firmness together, but her eyes, uplifted when
Sarah most undeniably shook her, were anguished.</p>

<p>"If you'd open your mouth and speak," said
Sarah with every indication of shaking her
again.</p>

<p>A stout gentleman coming along the side
street which led from a car-line crossed over
hastily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, here! And what for?" Uncle Charlie
asked with spirit.</p>

<p>Sarah looked up at him. With her long,
tidy plaits and her tidy person she conveyed
the impression that she was to be depended
on. Maud looked up at him. With her small
tidy plaits and her tidy person she conveyed
the impression that she was to be depended
on, too.</p>

<p>Albert Eddie looked up. Mr. Dawkins was
to be congratulated on his family. There was
dependability in every warm freckle of Albert
Eddie's face.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, Uncle Charlie's own Emmy
Lou, had been looking up the while, anguished.
She was a reliable person in general herself, or
Uncle Charlie always had found her so.</p>

<p>"If she'd open her mouth and speak," said
Sarah. "Half an hour ago by the clock it was,
she gave a sound, and I turned, and here she
was like this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sister was telling us a story&mdash;&mdash;" from Albert
Eddie.</p>

<p>"The story of naughty Harryminta&mdash;&mdash;"
from Maud.</p>

<p>"No use your trying, sir," from Sarah.
"I've been trying for half an hour. We're
taking her home."</p>

<p>"Excellent idea." He took Emmy Lou's
little hands. "So you won't tell Uncle Charlie
either?"</p>

<p>Evidently she would not, though it was with
visible increase of anguish that she indicated
this by a shake of her head.</p>

<p>"We'll walk along," said Sarah. "I've my
part of supper to get, but we'll feel better ourselves
to see her home."</p>

<p>They walked along.</p>

<p>"I was talking to them peaceful as might
be&mdash;&mdash;" from Sarah again.</p>

<p>"Sister was telling us a story&mdash;&mdash;" from Albert
Eddie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"The story of naughty Harryminta&mdash;&mdash;"
from Maud.</p>

<p>Was it a sound here from Uncle Charlie's
Emmy Lou, or the twitch of her hand in his,
which betrayed some access to her woe?</p>

<p>"And what was the story?" asked Uncle
Charlie. It might afford a clue.</p>

<p>Maud volunteered it. "The little girl's
mother said to her, 'Don't.' And her name was
Harryminta. And when she got back from
doing what she was told not to do, her mother
was waiting for her at the door. 'Whose little
girl is this?' And Harryminta said, 'Why,
it's your little girl.' But her mother shook
her head. 'Not my little girl at all. <i>My little
girl is a good little girl.</i>' And shut the door."</p>

<p>"Talk about your coincidence," said Uncle
Charlie afterward. "Talk about your Nemesis
and such!"</p>

<p>For as the group came along the street&mdash;the
Dawkins family, Uncle Charlie, and Emmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Lou&mdash;and turned in at the gate, Aunt Cordelia
flung the front door open. Aunt Katie and
Aunt Louise were behind her. They had really
just missed Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"Whose little girl is this?" said Aunt Cordelia,
severely. But not going as far as the
mother of Araminta she did not shut the door.
Instead, Sarah explained.</p>

<p>"Half an hour ago by the clock&mdash;&mdash;" Sarah
began.</p>

<p>They led her into the hall, and Aunt Cordelia
lifted her up on the marble slab of the
pier table. Aunt Cordelia's admonitions and
mandates came from the heart. "Open your
mouth and speak out and tell me what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou opened her mouth, and in the
act, though visibly against her stoutest endeavor
even to an alarming accession of pink
to her face, ominously and unmistakably&mdash;whooped;
the same followed on her part by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the full horror of comprehension, and then by
a wail.</p>

<p>For with that whoop the worst had happened.
As with the little boys and girls in
Bob's dire category of naughty little boys
and girls, her sin had found her out indeed.</p>

<p>"I'm coming to pieces," wailed their terrified
Emmy Lou, "because I didn't mind."</p>

<p>And according to her understanding she
was, since after her vain endeavor for half an
hour by Sarah's clock to hold it in place with
tongue and lips, in her palm lay a tooth, the
first she had shed or known she had to shed,
knowledge coming not by nature but through
understanding.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia did not carry out her
program the day school opened. There was
whooping-cough at her house, and a day or
so after there was whooping-cough at Mr.
Dawkins'.</p>

<p>"He is very indignant about it," Aunt Cordelia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
told Uncle Charlie. "He stopped me as
I came by this morning from my marketing.
He said it wasn't even as though we were customers."</p>

<p>"Which is the least we can be after this, I'm
sure you will agree," said Uncle Charlie.</p>

<p>Just here in the conversation, Emmy Lou,
miserable and stuffy in a pink sacque over her
habitual garb because Aunt Cordelia most emphatically
insisted, whooped.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Those <i>good</i> little girls, Marianne and Maria,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Were happy and well as <i>good</i> girls could desire&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Aunt Louise.</div>

<p>Aunt Cordelia, approaching with a bottle
and spoon as she did after every cough, shook
her head. "Little girls who mind are good
little girls," she said.</p>

<p>"Emmy Lou is learning to be a good little
girl while she is shut up in the house sick,"
said Aunt Katie. "She knows all of her Commandments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
In Verse for Sunday school now.
Let Aunt Cordelia wipe the cough-syrup off
your mouth and say them for Uncle Charlie
before he goes."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou learning to be a good little girl
said them obediently.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Thou shalt have no more gods but me;<br />

</div>

<p>Aunt Cordelia, Aunt Katie and Aunt
Louise looked pleased. Emmy Lou had said
the verses without stumbling. Uncle Charlie
looked doubtful. "Five words with understanding
rather than ten thousand in an unknown
tongue? How about it, Cordelia?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>But Bob, bringing Emmy Lou's dinner upstairs
to her on a tray, had the last disturbing
word. "Been tryin' to riccollect how it went,
'bout thet li' girl kep' her tongue outer the
place whar her tooth drapped out, so's a new
tooth would grow in."</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TRIBUNAL OF CONSCIENCE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Uncle Charlie</span> took six blue tickets from
his pocket and set them on the dining-room
mantel. His ownership of a newspaper was
the explanation for this liberality of supply
to those who could put the two things together.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said he, "if anybody in this
room ever heard of the circus?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou could not get down from her
place at the dinner-table fast enough. She hurried
to the kitchen. She had heard of the circus
from Bob the house-boy, who had a circus
bill!</p>

<p>Bills, as a rule, are small affairs measurable
in inches; bits of paper which reduce Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Cordelia to figurings with a lead pencil, short
replies, and low spirits.</p>

<p>But a circus bill, pink and pictorial, is measurable
in feet. As Bob spread his on the
kitchen table yesterday and again this morning,
it fell either side well on the way to the
floor. Its wonders, inexplicable where he,
spelling out the text, forebore to explain, or
explicable where he did if one knew no better
than he, were measurable only by the limits
of the mind to take them in. If Emmy Lou,
who started to school last fall three weeks late
owing to a popular prejudice against whooping-cough,
had caught up as Aunt Cordelia
easily assumed she would, or "caught on," in
the words of Uncle Charlie, she might have
been spelling out some of the wonders of the
circus bill for herself.</p>

<p>Bob's finger had paused beneath a lady in
myriad billowing skirts poised mid-air between
a horse and a hoop such as Emmy Lou spent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hours trying to trundle on the sidewalk. "She's
jumpin' th'ough the hoop, but thet ain't
nothin'. Heah in the other picture she's
jumpin' th'ough six."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, hurrying to the kitchen now
and finding Bob about to start in with the soup,
borrowed the bill and hurried back with it to
the dining-room and Uncle Charlie's side.</p>

<p>"This one's an elephant," she explained, her
finger, even as Bob's, beneath the picture. "He
picks little children up and puts them in his
trunk."</p>

<p>"I see you know, though some do call it his
howdah," said Uncle Charlie. "And no doubt
about the lions and the tigers, the giraffe and
the zebra as well?" regretfully. "Even the
lemonade?"</p>

<p>"Lemonade?"</p>

<p>"Pink. And peanuts." Uncle Charlie motioned
to Bob to put his soup down and have
done with it, as it were. "Also Nella, The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Child Equestrienne in Her Triumphal Entry&mdash;here
she is. And Zephine, the Wingless
Wonder, in Her Flight Through the Air&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am I going to the circus?" from Emmy
Lou.</p>

<p>"That's what I hoped," from Uncle Charlie,
handing back the bill and turning to his soup.
"But of course if there is room for doubt
about it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The very next day Emmy Lou came hurrying
home from Sunday school. She had the
Dawkins, Sarah, the conscientious elder sister,
Maud, and Albert Eddie, for company as far
as the grocery at the corner. Since Aunt
Cordelia had learned they were English, apparent
explanation for those who understood,
they had been persuaded to go to St. Simeon's
Sunday school too.</p>

<p>Sunday school was to have a&mdash;Emmy Lou
in her Sunday dress and her Sunday hat, hurrying
on from the corner by herself, tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
straighten this out before reaching home and
reporting it. What was it Sunday school was
to have? In Uncle Charlie's study&mdash;a small
back room, somewhat battered and dingy but,
as he claimed in its defense, his own&mdash;was a
picture of a stout little man propelled in a
wheelbarrow by some other men.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou had discovered that Uncle Charlie
loved the little man and prized the picture.
When she asked who he was and where he
was going in the wheelbarrow, Uncle Charlie
said it was <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> going to a <i>picnic</i>.
Or, and here was the trouble, was it <i>Mr. Picnic</i>
going to a <i>pickwick?</i> It depended on this what
Sunday school was to have.</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie, hat and cane in hand, waiting
in the hall for Aunt Cordelia to start to church,
straightened out the matter. <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>
was going to a <i>picnic</i>. It then followed that
Emmy Lou, in general a brief person, had such
a store of information about the picnic she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was moved to share it with Uncle Charlie.
This common interest about the circus and their
recurring conversations about it were drawing
them together, anyhow. Her data about the
picnic on the whole was menacing in its character.
As, for example:</p>

<p>It was to be in Mr. Denby's grove. He
charged too much for it, but St. Simeon's could
not do any better. If you went too far away
from the swings and the benches the mamma
of some little pigs would chase you.</p>

<p>Further. You cannot go to St. Simeon's
picnic, or, indeed, to any picnic without a basket!
Emmy Lou had endeavored to find out
what sort of a basket and Sarah had cut her
short with the brief reply, "A picnic basket."</p>

<p>And, finally, "Albert Eddie wishes he'd
never started to St. Simeon's. Sarah says he
has to go to the picnic and he wants to go to
the circus!"</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia arriving in full church array<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
caught this last. "I've been meaning to
speak about it myself. I find the circus is
here for the one day only and that the day for
St. Simeon's picnic."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou received this as applying to the
Dawkins only. The information her inquiries
had enabled her to get together led her personally
to disparage picnics.</p>

<p>"Albert Eddie says Sarah made him wash
dishes at the last picnic he went to. And she
makes him carry baskets. That if he'd wash
dishes for 'em at the circus and carry water,
they'd let him in."</p>

<p>"Sarah, Maud, Albert Eddie, you, me, and
one ticket to spare; such was my idea," said
Uncle Charlie, he and Aunt Cordelia preparing
to start. "The only thing we've ever given
the Dawkins up to date is the whooping-cough.
Picnic or circus, duty or pleasure,
we'll have to put it to them which they want
it to be."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia, even at the risk of being late
to church, stopped short. She didn't see the
matter in any such fashion at all! "Emmy
Lou will prefer to go to her own Sunday
school picnic too, I hope," decidedly. "How
you distract and bother the child, Charlie!"</p>

<p>"I bother Emmy Lou? She and I are as
near good friends as people get to be. We
respect each other's honesty and go our own
ways. I am going to leave the tickets where
I put them yesterday. I planned to take her
and the Dawkins to the circus. You and she
can fight it out." He proceeded through the
open doorway to the stone steps.</p>

<p>"In that case," from Aunt Cordelia as she
followed him, "since you seem to put me in
the wrong, I leave it to her own conscience.
She is seven years old, a big girl going to
school and Sunday school, and ought to know
right from wrong." And the two were gone.</p>

<p>Conscience! Familiar shibboleth to the seventh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
age of little girls! Stern front behind
which Aunt Cordelia these days hides her kindly
features.</p>

<p>Somewhere beyond the neighborhood where
Emmy Lou lived with Aunt Cordelia and
Uncle Charlie, was the roundhouse and the
yards of a railroad. Or so Aunt Cordelia explained.
The roundhouse bell, rung every
hour by the watchman on his rounds, made
far-off melancholy tolling through the night.</p>

<p>The sins at seven, the chubby, endeavoring
Emmy Lou's sins, her cloak on the coat-closet
floor instead of the closet peg, mucilage on
Aunt Katie's rug where a paper outspread
before pasting began would have saved it&mdash;sins
such as these have no prod to reminder
more poignant than this melancholy tolling of
the roundhouse bell in the night.</p>

<p>"It is an uneasy conscience," Aunt Cordelia
invariably claimed when Emmy Lou, waking,
came begging for permission to get in her bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
"If your conscience was all that it should be,
you'd be asleep."</p>

<p>Yet did Aunt Cordelia, as a rule, leave those
matters to Emmy Lou's conscience which she
thought she did? Did Emmy Lou three out
of four Sundays find herself remaining at
church rather than on her road home because
she herself wanted to stay? Or taking off her
new dress on reaching home because she
wanted to get into the older one?</p>

<p>Or, rather, did she find her baffled if unsuspecting
self, coerced and bewildered, doing
these and other things in the name of choice
when the doing was not through choice at all?</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia was going to leave the decision
between the circus and the picnic to Emmy
Lou, too, because she said she was. Nor did
Aunt Cordelia, honest soul, or Emmy Lou,
unquestioning and trusting one, dream but that
she did.</p>

<p>"I'll see Sarah Dawkins," said Aunt Cordelia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise the very
next morning, "and arrange with her to look
after Emmy Lou at the picnic. We'll use the
small hamper for her basket. She can take
enough for herself and them. Bob can take her
and it around to the church corner where the
chartered street cars are to be waiting, and
put her in Sarah's charge there. I can't see,
Katie, why you oppose a cake with custard
filling for the basket."</p>

<p>"It's messy," said Aunt Katie, "both to take
and to eat."</p>

<p>"But if she likes it best?" from Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>It was the first thing come to Emmy Lou's
hearing lending appeal to the picnic; or light
on the purpose of the baskets.</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie arriving for dinner outmatched
it, however, by another appeal. "I
saw a new circus bill on the fence of the vacant
lot as I came by. A yellow bill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Emmy Lou hurried right down there from
the dinner-table. Nella, the Child Equestrienne,
was kissing her hand right to Emmy
Lou from her horse's back. And the elephant,
abandoning his customary dark business of
putting little children in his trunk, with unexpected
geniality was sitting on a stool before
a table drinking tea.</p>

<p>And the next day Bob outmatched this. He
had been to the grocery to see about chickens
for the picnic to which Emmy Lou ought to
want to go.</p>

<p>"There's a Flyin' Dutchman on the outside,
an' side-shows too. I seen about it on a bill
the other side of the grocery. A green bill."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou hurried down there. She didn't
see anything that she could identify as a Flying
Dutchman, perhaps because she was hazy
as to what a Dutchman was. But Zephine,
swinging by her <i>teeth</i>, was just leaping into
space.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I will let her wear her sprigged
muslin," said Aunt Cordelia at supper that
night. "A good many grown persons go in
the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Their excuse being to take the children&mdash;&mdash;"
from Uncle Charlie easily.</p>

<p>"I am not talking of the circus, Charlie, and
you know I am not," from Aunt Cordelia
sharply.</p>

<p>"She has decided then?"</p>

<p>"She certainly ought to have decided. There
never should have been any doubt. I'll put
in some little tarts, Katie; all children like
tarts."</p>

<p>Had Emmy Lou decided? She heard it assumed
that she had. Why, then, with this
sense of frustration and bewilderment was she
swallowing at tears?</p>

<p>"I certainly feel I may say Emmy Lou has
decided," repeated Aunt Cordelia. "I'm sure,
Katie, tarts are just the thing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll never believe it," said Uncle Charlie,
emphatically, nor was he referring to the
tarts.</p>

<p>Did he refuse to be party to any such idea?</p>

<p>"I would not be surprised," said he to Emmy
Lou the next evening, "if we hear the circus
rumbling by in the night. Our street is the
one they usually take from the railroad yards
to the circus-grounds. I put six tickets on
the mantelpiece where at the most we will need
only five. Suppose I take one and see what
I can do with it?"</p>

<p>"Emmy Lou has no idea but of going to
her own Sunday school picnic," said Aunt Cordelia.
"I wish, Charlie, you would be still
about your tickets and the circus."</p>

<p>"They are not my tickets. They are going
to stay right here. I merely was to go with
Emmy Lou on one of them. They are her
tickets to do with as she wants and to take
whom she pleases."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the circus did go by in the night,
according to report next morning, Emmy Lou
failed to hear it. Nor did the melancholy
of the tolling bell disturb her. Aunt Cordelia
said this was because she was going to
her Sunday school picnic as she should, and
had a quiet conscience.</p>

<p>"I come roun' by the circus as I come to
work," Bob said in the pantry where Aunt
Cordelia and he packed the basket with Emmy
Lou for spectator. "Gittin' them wagons with
the lookin'-glass sides ready for the perade.
Thet ol' elephant come swinging erlong like
he owned the y'earth. Mr. Charlie gimme a
ticket las' night to go."</p>

<p>Which reminded Emmy Lou. Even though
she was going to the picnic, there was comfort
in the thought those tickets yet on the mantelpiece
were hers. She went into the dining-room
and pushed a chair to the hearth. The
sprigged muslin she was to wear had a pocket,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and later when this dress was put on the tickets
which were her own were in the pocket.</p>

<p>If one never has been to a picnic the only
premises to go on are those given you.</p>

<p>"You haven't a thing to do but stay with
Maud and Albert Eddie, and mind Sarah,"
said Aunt Cordelia as she put Emmy Lou's
hat on her head and its elastic under her chin,
"except, of course, to look after your basket.
There is pink icing on the little cakes and a
good tablecloth that I don't want anything to
happen to under the beaten biscuits at the bottom.
There is ham and there's tongue and
there's chicken."</p>

<p>"I have to look after the basket," Emmy
Lou told Sarah as she and the Dawkins with
the rest of St. Simeon's Sunday school were
put aboard the excursion cars.</p>

<p>"Of course you do," said Sarah approvingly.
"We all do. It's right here. And," with the
heartiness of one distributing largesse in privileges,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the meanwhile settling her three charges
in their places, "when we get off the car Albert
Eddie shall carry it."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou had a seat between Albert Eddie
and Maud. Beyond Albert Eddie were three
little boys in knickerbockers, blouses, and straw
hats, as gloomy in face as he.</p>

<p>"Not only <i>let</i> him carry water for the elephant
but gave him <i>a ticket</i> for doing it," the
nearest one was saying to the other three.
"Had it with him when he got back. I saw
it myself. He lemme take it in my hand. A
<i>blue</i> ticket."</p>

<p>"Right past the circus grounds, tents and
all," from the second little boy as their car
came in sight of the beflagged tent city. "I'll
betcher they're gettin' ready for the parade
right now!"</p>

<p>Four glittering, turbaned beings appeared
around a tent, each leading a plumed and
caparisoned horse to a place before a gilded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and high-throned edifice. "Didn't I tell you
they were?" bitterly. A band crashed.</p>

<p>The heads of St. Simeon's Sunday school,
regardless of danger, craned out as one. The
more venturesome left their seats.</p>

<p>St. Simeon's chartered cars rolled inexorably
by. Heads came in. The venturesome
returned to their places.</p>

<p>"What is there to a picnic anyhow?" from
the third little boy. "Nothin' at all but what
you eat."</p>

<p>Albert Eddie staggered under the weight
of the basket when in time the car stopped on
the track along the dusty road outside Mr.
Denby's grove. But then one out of every
two persons descending from the several cars
was similarly staggering under the weight of
a basket.</p>

<p>Sarah and Maud, with Emmy Lou led by
either hand between them, followed Albert Eddie
with their own. After which, St. Simeon's,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
having brought all baskets to a common center
beneath a tree in the neighborhood of the ice-water
barrel, went off and left them.</p>

<p>"I'm going with a little girl who asked me,"
Maud told Sarah. "We won't go too far or
the mother of the little pigs will chase us."</p>

<p>"Albert Eddie, I told the ladies that you
would get the wood for a fire so we can put
the coffee on," said Sarah. "When you come
back from that you can take the bucket and
bring us the ice-water from the barrel for the
lemonade."</p>

<p>Sarah's glance came next to Emmy Lou, no
mixer in the world of Sunday school at best, as
Sarah before this had observed. Sarah frowned
perturbedly. Some are picnickers by intuition,
for example Maud and the little girl
gone off together; others come to it through
endeavor. It was seven-year-old Emmy Lou's
first picnic, and she in her sprigged muslin
stood looking to Sarah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah was a manager, but having yet to
manage for Emmy Lou her frown was perturbed.
Then her face cleared. She fetched a
flat if a trifle over-mossy stone and put it down
on the outskirts of the baskets grouped beneath
the sheltering tree, and near the ice-water barrel.
"There, now! You can sit down here
and look after the baskets till I get back," she
told Emmy Lou and was gone.</p>

<p>There is virtue in coming to a picnic. Aunt
Cordelia plainly gave one to understand so.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go play with the others,
little girl?" asked a lady who was tying on a
gingham apron as she hurried by. "Go over
to the swings and see-saws."</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou, no picnicker by intuition,
nor as yet by any other mode of arrival, was
grateful that she had to stay with the baskets,
and, had the lady paused long enough for a
reply, could say so.</p>

<p>Was there virtue in coming to the picnic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for Albert Eddie too? Emmy Lou on her
stone under the tree guarding baskets saw
him come back with his load of firewood. She
saw him next carrying the bucket of water from
the barrel.</p>

<p>And here some ladies approaching the baskets
beside Emmy Lou beneath the tree, and
casting appraising eyes over the outlay, began
to help themselves to the same! To this basket,
and that basket, and carry them away!
One even approached and laid hands on Emmy
Lou's own! It took courage to speak, but she
found it.</p>

<p>"It's mine," from Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"And just the very nicest looking one I have
seen," said the lady heartily after raising the
lid and probing into the contents. "Anyone
would be glad to say it was hers," and went off
with it! St. Simeon's with a commendable
sense of fellowship made a common feast from
its picnic baskets at long tables for all, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Emmy Lou did not know this. She only saw
her cake with the custard filling, her cakes
with the pink icing, her tarts, her ham and
tongue, her chicken and biscuits and tablecloth
borne off from her with a coolness astounding
and appalling.</p>

<p>Virtue is hers who dully endures a picnic.
Emmy Lou, coming out of her stun and daze
and seeing some little boys approaching, the
ice-water barrel being a general Mecca, swallowed
hard that, did they notice her, they
might not see how near she was to crying.
Three little boys in knickerbockers, blouses,
and straw hats they were, still with their common
air of being more than justifiably aggrieved.</p>

<p>They noticed her and at the abrupt halt of
one, all stopped.</p>

<p>"We saw her on the car," he said. "<i>What's
she got?</i>"</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Why should that monstrous bulk of elephant have trumpeted just then?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>For Emmy Lou's hand some time since had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
brought forth for comfort from her pocket
the blue tickets which were her own. That
hand closed on them at the question now. She'd
just seen her basket go!</p>

<p>"<i>Are</i> they circus tickets? Sure? Lemme
see them? Aw, what you scared of, lettin' me
see 'em in my hand?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou did not know just what. The
ways of a picnic and those attending were new
to her, but what she had learned discouraged
confidence. Her hand and the tickets in it
went behind her.</p>

<p>"Where'd she get 'em?" the boy asked now
of Albert Eddie, arriving with his bucket for
more water.</p>

<p>He set the bucket down by the barrel and
joined the group.</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose they are really hers?" was
the query put to him as he got there.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou knew Albert Eddie, had known
him for a long time as time is measured at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
seven years. He looked after her on the way
to and from Sunday school even though he did
it at Sarah's bidding, whereas Maud forgot
her. Moreover, he had not wanted to come to
the picnic, and, bond firmly established between
them, neither had she. She surrendered
her tickets into his hands to be inspected. She
even credentialed them. The others had
doubted them! "They're mine. My Uncle
Charlie said so. To take anybody I wanted to
take if I hadn't had to come here!"</p>

<p>Her tickets! Five by actual count and actual
touch! To do what she pleased with!
This plump little girl with the elastic of her
hat under her chin, sitting alone at the picnic
on a stone!</p>

<p>The conversation in the group became choric
and to some extent Delphic, Emmy Lou, with
her eyes on the tickets in Albert Eddie's hands,
alone excluded.</p>

<p>"Aw, we could!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Follow the track!"</p>

<p>"Could she do it?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't so far she couldn't if we start now."</p>

<p>Four little boys, nearing nine, Albert Eddie,
Logan, John, and Wharton, made Machiavellian
through longing, turned to this little girl
on her stone and made court to her as they
knew how.</p>

<p>"Aw, you ask her! You know her!" from
Logan to Albert Eddie.</p>

<p>Albert Eddie cleared his throat. He'd carried
the basket. He'd carried the wood. He'd
carried the water. He was bitter to desperate
lengths, indeed, and in the rebound no good
and obedient little boy at all but one gloriously
afloat on seas of dire and reckless abandon.</p>

<p>"We'll take you to the circus, these boys
and me, and let you see everything, if you want
us to," with a <i>diablerie</i> of cunning so appalling
and so convicting in its readiness he knew he
must falter if he stopped to consider it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tain't as if we hadn't been before, every
one of us," from Logan, with that yet greater
cunning of the practiced and the artist, indifference;
"but we wouldn't mind taking you."</p>

<p>"I been twice," from Wharton mightily.</p>

<p>"I been once, last year," from Albert Eddie.</p>

<p>"I been twice in <i>one</i> year," from John, "here
at home and when I went to visit my grandmother."</p>

<p>"I been twice to one show," from Logan,
eclipsing them all. "One day with one uncle,
and the next day with another!"</p>

<p>And Emmy Lou never had been at all! The
tickets, most cunning play of all, had been put
back in her own hand.</p>

<p>"Old clown he threw his hat up, turned a
handspring, and come up and caught it on
his head," from Wharton. "We'll show you
the clown."</p>

<p>"&mdash;rode one horse standing and driving five
and kissed her hand every time she came by&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Logan, forgetting his cue and his cunning, was
saying to Albert Eddie and John.</p>

<p>"&mdash;picks out the letters, that dog does, and
spells his own name&mdash;" John, forgetting his
cue and his cunning, was saying to Albert Eddie
and Logan.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou moved on her stone.</p>

<p>"&mdash;rolls in a big keg, that elephant does, and
turns it up and sits down on it. We'll show
you the elephant too," Wharton, faithful to his
cue, was saying to her.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou stood up. She handed the tickets
to whoever might be to take charge of
them. She put her hand in Albert Eddie's.
"I didn't want to come to the picnic and not
go to the circus," she said.</p>

<p>They were grateful and solicitous little boys.
They hurried her unduly, perhaps, in getting
her out of the grounds, but once upon the
safer territory of road beside the track they
were mindful of her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll take her by one hand," said Logan to
Albert Eddie, "and you keep hold of her by
the other hand, because she knows you."</p>

<p>Whatever that hot, dusty, shadeless, that appalling
stretch of country road meant to Emmy
Lou, she never afterward referred to it.
But then there were reasons making silence
more natural on her part.</p>

<p>Yet she saw the circus! Emmy Lou saw
the circus! Come what might, she had that!</p>

<p>What that they arrived at the circus entrance
dinnerless, dust-laden, and, but for a stop
along the way at a pump and trough, thirsty!</p>

<p>What that the man sitting at the mouth of
the passage between canvas walls, to whom
the tickets were handed, eyed them, four unattended
little boys taking marked care of one
little girl in their midst&mdash;since he let them by
and in!</p>

<p>Sawdust, orange-peel, flaring gas jets,
camel, lions, big pussy-tiger, Oh, glorious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
unmatchable blend of circus aroma! Oh, vast
circling sweep and reach of seats and faces,
with four little boys guarding one little girl
in their midst, wandering along looking for
places!</p>

<p>Oh, blare of brass, Oh, fanfare of trumpets,
Oh, triumphant entry of all hitherto but dimly
sensed and hauntingly visioned, color, pageant,
rhythm, triumph, glory, heretofore lost as they
came, but now palpable, tangible, and existent!</p>

<p>Oh, pitiful, a bit terrifying, white-faced
clown! The butt, the mock, the bear-all! Emmy
Lou does not laugh at the clown! Because
she pities him and is sorry for him, her heart
goes out to him instead! And she trembles
for Nella as her horse urged by the snapping,
menacing whip sweeps by faster and even faster&mdash;and
she cries out when at the crash of
the kettle-drums, Zephine leaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I didn't see the elephant like I did the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
lions and the camel and the tiger," she tells
Logan and Albert Eddie and the others. Nor
had she. The elephant had gone to take his
place in the triumphal entry when Emmy Lou
and her four cicerones, in their progress
through the animal tent before the program,
reached his roped-in inclosure.</p>

<p>And so they made their way back to him
through the surging crowd as they went out,
four solicitous little boys conducting Emmy
Lou. Made their way as near as might be,
then pushed her through the row of spectators
in front of them to the rope.</p>

<p>"He picks little children up and puts them
in his trunk," she was saying as one fascinated
by the very awfulness of that she dwelt on, as
they squeezed her through.</p>

<p>Why should that monstrous bulk of elephant
have trumpeted just then&mdash;as Emmy Lou
emerged at the rope&mdash;have flung his trunk
out in all the lordly condescension of a mighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
one willing to stoop, in the accustomed quest
of peanuts?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Aunt Louise, returning from a futile trip
to the church corner to meet Emmy Lou, had
just explained that the picnic had not returned,
being delayed, so rumor said, by the
search for five missing children, when Bob
walked in bringing a dust-laden Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"Came on her at the circus?" from Aunt
Cordelia incredulously.</p>

<p>"In the animal tent roun' there whar thet
elephunt is," Bob <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diagramed'">diagrammed</ins>.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou's face, bearing marks of recent
agitation, showed agitation anew.</p>

<p>"Good work," from Uncle Charlie, just arrived
himself. "Who was with her?"</p>

<p>"Some li'l boys, she says. She warn't with
nobody when I come on her runnin' f'om thet
elephunt toward me without knowin' it, an'
screamin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Emmy Lou's agitation broke into speech
mingled with tears. "He picks little children
up and puts them in his trunk. And he tried
to pick up me!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Along in the night Emmy Lou awaking
found that she wanted a drink. These warm
June nights the water bottle and tumbler sat
on the sill of the open window in Aunt Cordelia's
room, which meant that Emmy Lou
must get out of bed and patter in there to
them.</p>

<p>Reaching the window&mdash;was Emmy Lou in
her nightgown and her bare feet really there
and awake or in her bed in reality and direly
dreaming?</p>

<p>Was it so or not so, this looming, swinging,
menacing bulk, palpably after her
again, approaching adown the silent, dusky
street?</p>

<p>Seven years old and a little, little girl, Emmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Lou fled to Aunt Cordelia's bedside and
tugged at her arm to get her awake.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia, taking her into her bed,
soothed her, her hand massaging up and down
back, shoulders, little thighs, comfortingly
enough, even the while she scolds. She takes
it without question that Emmy Lou has been
dreaming.</p>

<p>"It is what comes of being a naughty little
girl again. We never sleep well when our
conscience is uneasy."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou lay close. Conscience! Aunt
Cordelia said so!</p>

<p>Nor did Aunt Cordelia dream, nor Emmy
Lou suspect, that the monstrous, looming
shape padding along the silent street beyond
the open window with its broad sill was the
circus elephant making his way to the railroad
yard and his traveling car, the yard where the
roundhouse bell even now made melancholy
tolling in the night.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LIONS IN THE PATH</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Emmy Lou</span> came home at close of her first
day in the Second Reader. "I sit with Hattie,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Aunt Katie.</p>

<p>"Where does she come from?" added Aunt
Louise.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was perplexed. Who is Hattie?
In her pink-sprigged dress with her plaits
tied behind her either ear? Breathing briskness
and conviction? Why, Hattie is <i>Hattie</i>.
But how convey this to Aunt Katie?</p>

<p>And where does she come from? How does
Emmy Lou know? Or how is she expected to
know? The population of school, in common
with the parallel world of Sunday school, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
no background other than school itself, but assembling
out of the unknown and segregated
into Primer Class, First Reader, Second Reader,
even as Sunday school is segregated into
Infant Class, Big Room, and Bible Class, performs
its functions and disperses. Where,
then, does Hattie come from?</p>

<p>"She came out of the cloakroom, and she
asked me to sit with her."</p>

<p>Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise laughed.
They have laughed at Emmy Lou before in
this sense and so have others. She has said
"Madam and Eve" happily and unsuspectingly
all these years until Aunt Katie discovered
it and not only laughed but <i>told</i>, and
Aunt Louise, in whose person and carriage
Emmy Lou takes pride, was a "blunette" until
she found it out and laughed and told.</p>

<p>A little boy at school as long ago as last
year laughed and told a boy named Billy who
Emmy Lou had believed was her friend: "Ho,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Teacher told her to wait there for the present,
and she thinks it's a present," And at Sunday
school a little girl laughed and told: "She
thinks her nickel, that nickel in her hand, is
going up to God."</p>

<p>In consequence of these betrayals of a heart
too faithfully shown and a confidence too
earnestly given, Emmy Lou is cautious now,
laughter having become a lion in the path and
ridicule a bear in the bush.</p>

<p>A picture hangs above Aunt Cordelia's mantelpiece.
It has been there ever since Emmy
Lou came to make her home with her aunties,
but she was seven years old when she asked
about it.</p>

<p>"Where is the man going?" she said then to
Aunt Cordelia. "What will the lions do to
him?"</p>

<p>"He is going <i>right onward</i>. The lions in his
path will turn him aside if they can."</p>

<p>"Correct," said Uncle Charlie overhearing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"But the lions can't turn the trick. See the
man's sword? And his buckler? The sword of
his courage, and the buckler of the truth."</p>

<p>"Who is the man?" Emmy Lou wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"The anxious pilgrim of all time," said Uncle
Charlie.</p>

<p>But Aunt Cordelia, taking Emmy Lou on
her lap, explained. "The man is any one of
us&mdash;you, me, Uncle Charlie, your little friends
Maud and Albert Eddie down at the corner,
everybody. If we meet our lions as we should,
with courage and the truth, they, nor anything,
can prevent our going right onward."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh, let the pilgrims, let the pilgrims then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Be vigilant and quit themselves like men!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Uncle Charlie.</div>

<p>And now laughter has become a lion in Emmy
Lou's path. Will Hattie, her new friend,
laugh at her? One can refrain from showing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
one's heart to Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise,
but in the world of school Emmy Lou needs a
friend.</p>

<p>Omniscience at home is strangely wanting
about this world of school, perhaps because
Emmy Lou's aunties in their days went to establishments
such as Mr. Parson's Select Academy,
where the pupil is the thing, and school
and teachers even a bit unduly glad to have
and hold her, whereas Emmy Lou at her school
has not found herself in the least the thing.</p>

<p>In saying she was to sit with Hattie she
was implying that she was grateful indeed for
the overture, whereas Aunt Katie and Aunt
Louise, taking it the other way, ask who Hattie
is and where she comes from.</p>

<p>Aunt Katie said more: "We must find out
something about her. Suppose you try?"</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou in one short day has divined
all she needs to know, though she does
not know how to tell this to Aunt Katie. Hattie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
is Hattie, life a foe to be overcome, this
world the lists, and Hattie the challenged, her
colors lowered or surrendered never, though
the lance of her spirit be shivered seventy times
seven and her helmet of conviction splintered.</p>

<p>And Emmy Lou?&mdash;who, as complement to
this divination, loves Hattie?&mdash;Emmy Lou,
what with over-anxious debate, what with caution,
what with weight of evidence and its considering,
is the anxious pilgrim of all time,
lions in the path and bears in the bush.</p>

<p>Hurrying off to school the next morning to
resume the grateful business of sharing a desk
with this new friend, Emmy Lou found Hattie
waiting for her at the gate even as she had
said she would be, and life today, even as life
yesterday from the initial moment of acquaintance
with Hattie, became crowded at once,
even jostled and elbowed with happening and
information.</p>

<p>As the two took their places in the line forming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at the sound of the school-bell, a little girl
pushed in ahead of them where there was no
place until she by crowding made one. But
she did not care for that and showed it, her
curls, which shone like Aunt Cordelia's copper
hot-water jug, tossing themselves, and her
skirts flaunting.</p>

<p>Hattie explained this. "She asked me to
sit with her, that's why she's crowding us now.
Her name is Sally Carter. But I choose, I
don't take my friends." Her voice lowered
and one gathered that following was an accusation,
even an indictment. "She's the richest
little girl in the class and wants you to know it.
And she is an Episcopalian, too."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou felt anxious. Would Hattie
laugh? "I don't know what an Episcopalian
is."</p>

<p>But she seemed to regard the admission as
commendable. "Sally's church gave an entertainment
and called it for the orphans' fund,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and she did the Highland Fling on the stage."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou had no idea what the Highland
Fling was, either, but the line had reached the
entrance doorway beyond which speech is
forbidden. Except for this, must she have
said she did not know? Or might she refrain
from committing herself?</p>

<p>For there are different ways of meeting your
lions. Emmy Lou knew two ways. Last year
at school a little girl stood up in the aisle for
no reason but a disposition to do so. Promptly
and sharp came the rap of a pencil on the
teacher's desk.</p>

<p>Lion in the path of the little girl! Lion of
reprimand! But the little girl threw dust in
the lion's eyes. "Oh, didn't the bell ring for
everyone to stand?" she inquired. And sat
down.</p>

<p>There is another way. Emmy Lou walked
in on her friends the Dawkins one day, over
the grocery at the corner, to find Albert Eddie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in trouble. Possibly more than any person of
Emmy Lou's acquaintance, he seemed an anxious
pilgrim of all time too.</p>

<p>"Stand right where you are," Sarah his big
sister was saying to him. "You've had something
in your mouth again that you shouldn't.
Don't tell me. Can't I smell it now I try?"</p>

<p>Albert Eddie was sniffling, which with a
little boy is the first step on the road to crying.
But he met his lion.</p>

<p>"It's cigars off the catalpa tree," he wept,
and went on into the next room and to bed
even as Sarah had forewarned him.</p>

<p>And so, as soon as Emmy Lou is free to
speak, she must tell Hattie that she does not
know what the Highland Fling is? Alas,
that in the exigencies of sharing a desk with
this person and incidentally fulfilling the functions
of the Second Reader she forgot to
do so!</p>

<p>At the school gate at the close of the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Hattie said, "Come go to the corner with me,
and I'll show you where I live."</p>

<p>Go with Hattie? Her friend and more, her
monitor and protector? Who the day through
had steered her by the Charybdis of otherwise
certain mistake, and past the Scylla of otherwise
inevitable blunder? Go with her at her
asking? Did rescued squire follow his protecting
knight in fealty of gratitude? Did faithful
<i>Sancho</i> fall in at heel at his <i>Quixote's</i>
bidding? Emmy Lou, who always went
hurrying home because she was bidden so to
do, faced around today and went the other
way.</p>

<p>Hattie lived in a brick house in a yard. Pausing
at her gate she made a proposition. "If
you could go to my Sunday school I can come
by and get you."</p>

<p>"I go to Sunday school," said Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>Hattie was regretful but acquiescent. "Of
course, if you go. I didn't know. I'll walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
back with you and see where you live. I'm
Presbyterian. What are you?"</p>

<p>Having no idea what Presbyterian was, how
could Emmy Lou say in kind what she was?</p>

<p>A little girl just arrived at a neighboring
gate, an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the Second Reader also,
though Emmy Lou did not know her, joined
Hattie and Emmy Lou as they passed. Hattie
knew her and, such is the open sesame of
one achieved friend, Emmy Lou found that
she was to be considered as knowing her also.
Her name was Sadie.</p>

<p>"I've just told her I'm Presbyterian," Hattie
explained.</p>

<p>"I'm Methodist," said Sadie. "That's my
church across the street."</p>

<p>Methodist is Sadie's church, and Presbyterian
then is Hattie's? The names in both cases
being abbreviated without doubt, and in seemlier
phrase, St. Methodist and St. Presbyterian?
Emmy Lou is on ground entirely familiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to her now, and she shifts her school-bag and
her lunch-basket relievedly, for while the pilgrim
must not fail to say she does not know
when she does not, yet surely she may take
advantage of a knowledge gained through finding
out?</p>

<p>"I go to St. Simeon's P. E. Church," she
stated. "It's 'round on Plum Street."</p>

<p>"What sort of church is that?" said Hattie.</p>

<p>"It's a stone church with a vine," said Emmy
Lou, nor even under questioning could she
give further information.</p>

<p>Reversing the idea of Aunt Katie and Aunt
Louise, Hattie would seem to be gradually
finding out who and what Emmy Lou is?
Friendship evidently must rest upon declared
foundations. Emmy Lou goes to Sunday
school and her church is on Plum Street. So
far so good. But one and yet another lion
faced, another and another spring up.</p>

<p>"Have you taken the pledge?" asks Hattie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Emmy Lou in her time has taken the measles
and also the chicken-pox, and more latterly
the whooping-cough. And also given it. But
the pledge? Has she taken it, and failed to
recall it? And is it desirable or undesirable
that she should have taken it?</p>

<p>"I've taken it," says Sadie in a tone that
leaves no doubt that one should have taken it.</p>

<p>While the pilgrim must scorn to throw dust
in the eyes through evasion, may she not hope
for advantage through finding out again? Or
must she definitely draw her sword and face
this lion by saying that she does not know?</p>

<p>Bob, the house-boy, sent to hunt her, is the
instrument of her respite. He brought up
before the advancing group. Time was when
he would have said, "Reckon you is done forgot
whut happened to thet li'l girl whut didn't
come straight home like she was tol'." But
Emmy Lou is a big girl and Bob acknowledges
it. "Reckon you is done forgot whut happens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
about dessert for them that don't come on
time to get it."</p>

<p>The implication dismaying even Hattie and
Sadie, they took leave of Emmy Lou
hastily.</p>

<p>"You can tell us about your pledge another
time," Hattie called. "Maybe we will come
around to see you this afternoon to get better
acquainted."</p>

<p>Despite Bob's implication, Aunt Cordelia
had saved some dessert for Emmy Lou. By
diligent application to her dinner she even
caught up with the others and thus achieved
time for an inquiry. Was it on her mind that
Hattie and Sadie might come around this
afternoon?</p>

<p>"What's the pledge?"</p>

<p>"Which variety?" from Uncle Charlie. "It
might be a toast."</p>

<p>"Or a pawn," said Aunt Louise.</p>

<p>"Or a surety," said Aunt Katie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"And also an earnest," from Uncle Charlie.
"Take your choice."</p>

<p>"Now stop mystifying her," said Aunt Cordelia.
"There is altogether too much of it.
I won't allow it. A pledge, Emmy Lou, such
as you probably are thinking about, is a promise.
I daresay some of the little boys you know
have taken one. I hear it's quite the thing.
Now, hurry. That's why I sent Bob after
you. Dancing school has been changed from
Saturday to Friday afternoon, and you have
only half an hour to dress and get there. Aunt
Katie is going with you."</p>

<p>"But," dismayed, "two little girls said maybe
they would come to see me."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry. I will see them for you
if they come. Now, hurry."</p>

<p>And Emmy Lou accordingly hurried. For
while the claims of school are all very well in
Aunt Cordelia's regard, the claims of church,
as Emmy Lou understands these claims, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
imperative. And, moreover, while school centers
itself and its activities within five days and
its own four walls, St. Simeon's is the center
of a clustering and revolving seven-day system.</p>

<p>On Monday Aunt Cordelia herself takes
Emmy Lou to old Mrs. Angell's sewing class
for the little girls of the Sunday school at the
rectory next door to the church. On Thursday
Aunt Louise takes her to the singing class for
the children of the Sunday school at the organist's,
across the street from the church.
And her aunties share among them the duty of
getting her twice a week to dancing school,
taught by Miss Eustasia, the niece of Dr. Angell,
at her home next door on the other side
of St. Simeon's. The Church assembles its
youthful populace here in force as Emmy Lou
grasps it, old Mr. Pelot, who taught Miss Eustasia
herself in her day and the mammas and
papas of St. Simeon's in their day too, wielding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a bow and violin and being her assistant.</p>

<p>Dancing school! Emmy Lou, hurrying, is
getting ready. School among schools, secular,
sewing, singing, or Sunday, of endeavor, effort,
and anxious perturbation! Aunt Cordelia
does her best to help Emmy Lou along.
She takes her in the parlor from time to time,
after dinner, after supper, and, sitting down
to the piano, strikes the chords. Aunt Cordelia's
playing has a tinkling, running touch,
and her tunes have an old-fashioned sound.</p>

<p>"<i>One</i>, two, three, start now&mdash;" Aunt Cordelia
says. "Why didn't you start when I
said? Katie, go away from the door, you and
Louise both. You have laughed at her dancing,
and she won't do a thing while you are
here."</p>

<p>Then again to the endeavor. <i>One</i>, two,
three, <i>one</i>, two, three, alike the chant and hope
and stay of dancing. Emmy Lou starts right;
she is sure that her right foot leads out on time:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
but the difficulty is, the while she pantingly
counts, to bring up the left foot on the moment.</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie stops in the parlor doorway
while he lights a cigar before returning downtown.
"We might think the left foot was
faithful to the Church and only the right given
over to the World, but that Eustasia plys her
art in the shadow of St. Simeon's."</p>

<p>One foot to the Church and the other to the
World? What does Uncle Charlie mean? Are
aspersions to be cast on dancing by other than
its victims? Or can it be that Uncle Charlie,
too, like Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise, is laughing
at her?</p>

<p>But today Emmy Lou and Aunt Katie go
hurrying off to dancing school, Emmy Lou
in her Sunday dress devoted to St. Simeon's
functions, carrying her slippers in their
bag.</p>

<p>Miss Eustasia's house is old and shabby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
She lives here with her mother who is Dr.
Angell's sister, a lady who crosses her hands
resignedly and says to the mammas and visitors
at dancing school, "Eustasia was not
brought up to this; Eustasia was raised with
a right to the best."</p>

<p>Aunt Katie and Emmy Lou hurry in the
front door. Miss Eustasia in the long parlor
on one side of the hall is hurrying here and
hurrying there, a little frown of bother and of
earnestness between her brows, marshalling
some classes into line, whirling others about
face to face in couples. And old Mr. Pelot,
tall and thin, with a grand manner and an
arched nose, is rapping with his bow on the
mantel and calling for order. Mammas and
visitors are in place along the wall, and Dr.
Angell, who sometimes, as now, comes over
from the rectory to look on, beams and takes
off his glasses and rubs them, and, putting
them on, beams again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>All of which is as it should be, as Emmy Lou
understands it; and Miss Eustasia, born and
baptized, brought up and confirmed, as it were,
in the church next door, had to have something
to do. And St. Simeon's, gathering its children
together, offered her this, and at the
same time provided for Mr. Pelot, who, being
on everybody's mind in his old age, also had
to have something to do.</p>

<p>And St. Simeon's did itself proud. As Aunt
Katie and Emmy Lou came in, its Infant
Class, as Emmy Lou from long association
knew it, was out on the floor taking its first
position, while St. Simeon's Big Room, resolved
into skirts, sashes, and curls, or neat
shoes, smooth stockings, knickerbockers, jackets,
broad collars, and ties, was waiting its
turn to flutter lightly to places, or, bowing
stiffly, go into duty stoutly. After which its
Bible Class, now standing about in confidential
pairs, would go through their new figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in the cotillion sedately. Or so it was that
Emmy Lou coming in in her Sunday dress and
her slippers understood it.</p>

<p>"Just in time," said Miss Eustasia to her
briefly. "Get into line."</p>

<p>The Infant Class withdrawing to get its
breath, Emmy Lou finds herself between Logan
and Wharton in a newly forming line
stretching across the room. She is glad, because
they are her friends, having gone with
her on occasion to the circus, and she can ask
them about the pledge.</p>

<p>To each nature of school its vernacular:
rudiments and digits, head and foot, medals
and deportment, to the secular; bias and hem,
whipping and backstitch, to the sewing; chorus
and refrain, louder please, now softer, to
the singing; sponsors, catechism, texts, to the
Sunday; and Miss Eustasia now is speaking to
the class in the vernacular of the dancing
school.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, no," in discouragement of all attempts
at conversation. "Eyes in front, everybody,
on me, and take the first position. Now,
right hand on right hip, so. Left hand lifted
above left shoulder, so. Right foot out, heel
first&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you call it?" from Logan, desperate
with his efforts. "Have we had it before?
What's its name?"</p>

<p>"Its name," said Miss Eustasia severely, "is
the Highland Fling."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou found a moment before dispersal
to interview Logan and Wharton.
"What's the pledge? Have you taken it?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," said Logan, not so much
curt as embittered, so one gathered, by his
share in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Wharton was more explicit. "We don't
have pledges at our Sunday school."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou knew another little boy, Albert
Eddie. She went down to the corner the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
morning to see him. If the truth be told, she
still preferred the snugness of life over a grocery
to a house in a yard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawkins, on what she called a pinch,
went down in the grocery and helped. She
was there this Saturday morning, and Maud
with her. Sarah in the kitchen upstairs was
mixing the Saturday baking in a crock, and
Albert Eddie, being punished, was in a corner
on a stool.</p>

<p>Politeness dictating that the person in durance
be ignored, under these circumstances
Emmy Lou immediately addressed herself to
Sarah.</p>

<p>"What's the pledge? Do you know anybody
who's taken it?"</p>

<p>Sarah brought Albert Eddie right into it,
stool, corner, and all. "Albert Eddie can tell
you for he's just taken one. He's been a bad
boy again, and it wasn't catalpa cigars this
time either. And after he's been warned. I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
made him promise now. Albert Eddie, turn
round here and say your pledge."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Monday morning found Emmy Lou at the
school gate betimes. "I've got my pledge
now," she told Hattie and Sadie eagerly, as
together they arrived.</p>

<p>"Of course you have," from Hattie commendingly,
"I knew you must have taken one.
Say yours."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou said hers:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I'll never use tobacco, no,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It is a filthy weed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll never put it in my mouth&mdash;&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>She stopped. As could be seen in the horrified
faces of Hattie and Sadie, something was
wrong.</div>

<p>"They taught you that at your Sunday
school?" from Hattie.</p>

<p>"You, a little girl&mdash;&mdash;?" from Sadie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon the pilgrim, the pilgrim Emmy
Lou, saw it all, saw that she had but endeavored
to throw dust into eyes, beginning with
her own.</p>

<p>"I didn't get my pledge at Sunday school,
I got it from a little boy. I asked him and
he taught it to me. We don't have pledges
at my Sunday school."</p>

<p>"We went to see you on Friday like we
said, and you were out," said Hattie severely.</p>

<p>"They changed the day and I had to go,"
from Emmy Lou. "I was at dancing
school."</p>

<p>"Dancing school? Your Sunday school
doesn't have pledges and you go to dancing
school? Your church lets you go? Like Sally
Carter's? And you didn't tell us?"</p>

<p>"My church might give up pledges if it had
to," said Sadie, "but its foot is down on dancing."</p>

<p>Yet Hattie would be fair. "Your minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
knows? What sort of dancing? What did you
dance on Friday?"</p>

<p>"Our minister was there. It is the Sunday
school that dances. We danced the Highland
Fling."</p>

<p>The school bell rang.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hattie as she turned to go,
"I'm Presbyterian."</p>

<p>Sadie bore witness as she turned to follow.
"And I'm Methodist."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou lifted her buckler and drew her
sword. Never dust in the eyes again. For
she knew now what she was over and above
being a St. Simeonite, having asked Aunt Cordelia.
In this company it bore not only the
odium of disapproval and the hall-mark of
condemnation, but from the qualifying term
applied to it by Aunt Cordelia would seem to
merit both.</p>

<p>"I'm a low church Episcopalian," said Emmy
Lou, the pilgrim, stoutly if wretchedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>When Emmy Lou reached home that day
Aunt Katie brought up an old matter. "Aunt
Cordelia rather likes the looks of the little girl
named Hattie who came here. So I suppose
it is all right for you to go on sitting with her.
What have you found out about her?"</p>

<p>What Emmy Lou would have liked to find
out was, would Hattie go on sitting with her?
But how make those things clear to Aunt
Katie?</p>

<p>"Charlie," said Aunt Cordelia to her brother
that night, "what on earth do children mean?
Emmy Lou as she was getting ready for bed
asked me why Hattie's church and Sadie's
church have the pledge and hers has the Highland
Fling? It isn't possible that she has confused
dancing and Sunday school?"</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie stared at his sister, then his
shout rang to heaven.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE IMPERFECT OFFICES OF PRAYER</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Recruiting</span> Sunday occurred at Emmy
Lou's Sunday school the winter she was eight.
The change to this nature of thing was sudden.
Hitherto when Hattie, her best friend,
who was Presbyterian, spoke of Rally Day,
or Sadie, her next best friend, who was Methodist,
spoke of Canvassing Day, Emmy Lou of
St. Simeon's refrained from dwelling on Septuagesima,
or Sexagesima, or Quinquagesima
Sunday, as the case might be, for fear it appear
to savor of the elect. As, of course, if
one has been brought up in St. Simeon's, and
by Aunt Cordelia, one has begun to feel it
does.</p>

<p>Hattie and Sadie, on the contrary, full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the business and zeal of Rally Day and Canvassing
Sunday, looked with pity on Emmy
Lou and St. Simeon's, and at thought of Quinquagesima
and such kindred Sundays shook
their heads. Which is as it should be, too.</p>

<p>For, while there is one common world of
everyday school in the firmament of the week,
drawing the Emmy Lous and Hatties and Sadies
into the fold of its common enterprise and
common fellowship, there are varying worlds
in the firmament of Sundays, withdrawing the
Emmy Lous and Hatties and Sadies into the
differing folds of rival enterprises, Hattie to
the First Presbyterian Church North, Sadie to
the Second Avenue M. E. Church South, and
Emmy Lou with no status or bias as to pole
at all, if we except polemics, to St. Simeon's
P. E.</p>

<p>And each one within her fold is so convinced
her fold is the only fold, it is her part to make
all others feel this. Which is as it should be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
too. And, as Hattie pointed out when Sadie
got worsted in being made to feel it and cried,
is only the measure of each one's proper Christian
zeal!</p>

<p>And Hattie, being full of data about her
Rally Day, and Sadie, being full of grace from
her Canvassing Day, were equipped at seemingly
every point for making another feel it.
Whereas when Sadie asked Emmy Lou what
Quinquagesima or fifty days before Easter
had to do with saving souls, and Hattie asked
her to spell it, Quinquagesima not only died
on her lips but she and it seemed indefensibly
and reprehensibly in the wrong. Which Emmy
Lou endeavored to remember was but a measure
of Christian zeal again.</p>

<p>And now St. Simeon's, awakening to its
needs in such zeal, was to have, not a Rally nor
yet a Canvassing, but a Recruiting Sunday.
For every Sunday school with any zeal whatever
has a nomenclature of its own and looks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
with pity and contumely on the nomenclature
of any other Sunday school. So that Emmy
Lou heard with a shock of incredulity that
what she knew as the Infant Class was spoken
of by Hattie as the Primary, and by Sadie as
the Beginners.</p>

<p>But this department of Sunday school, whatever
its designation, belongs to the early stages
of faith. Emmy Lou is in the Big Room, now,
and here has heard about St. Simeon's Recruiting
Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. Glidden, the superintendent, announced
it. He was a black-haired, slim, brisk young
man. Emmy Lou knew him well. She liked
Mr. Glidden. He came to see Aunt Louise,
and admired her. Week days he was a young
man who was going to do credit to his father
and mother. Aunt Cordelia said so. Sundays,
if he let his Christian zeal carry him too far,
his betters at St. Simeon's would have to call
him down. Uncle Charlie who was a warden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
at St. Simeon's said so, curtly, in a way most
disturbing.</p>

<p>In announcing Recruiting Sunday, Mr.
Glidden spoke with feeling. "In the business-run
world of today," he told his Sunday school,
"St. Simeon's must look at things in a business
way. What with Rally Day and Canvassing
Day in the other Sunday schools, St.
Simeon's stands no chance. Emulation must
be met with emulation. Let St. Simeon's get
out and work. And while it works,"&mdash;Mr.
Glidden colored; he was young&mdash;"let it not forget
it shall be its Superintendent's earnest and
also daily prayer that it be permitted to bring
even the least of these into the fold."</p>

<p>Furthermore, there should be inducements.
"For every new scholar brought in," said Mr.
Glidden, "there shall be an emblazoned card.
For every five emblazoned cards there shall be
a prize. Cards and prizes I shall take pleasure
in giving out of my own pocket."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>In the light of after events, as Emmy Lou
grasped them, the weakness in the affair lay
in Mr. Glidden's failure sufficiently to safeguard
his prayer.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou had considerable data about
prayer, gathered from her two friends, Hattie
being given to data, and Sadie being given to
prayer. As Hattie expounded prayer as exemplified
through Sadie, one fact stands paramount.
You should be specifically certain in
both what you ask and how you ask it. For
the answer can be an answer and yet be calamitous
too. Hattie used the present disturbing
case with Sadie for her proof.</p>

<p>Sadie and her brother decided they wanted
a little sister, and would pray for one. They
did pray, fervently and trustfully, being
Methodists, as Hattie pointed out, night after
night, each beside her or his little white bed.
And each was answered. It was twin little sisters.
Since when, Sadie was almost as good as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lost to her two friends, through having to hold
one little sister while her mother held the other.</p>

<p>"You've got to make what you want clear,"
Hattie argued. "They both prayed for a little
sister at the same time. If they'd prayed,
Sadie one night, and Anselm the next, or if
they'd said it was the same little sister, they
wouldn't 'a' had a double answer and so been
oversupplied."</p>

<p>Sadie was torn with conflict over it herself.
Her little sisters weren't justified to her yet,
but she wasn't going to admit they might not
still be, though the strain on her Christian zeal
was great.</p>

<p>For at Sadie's Sunday school you did not
get a prize for the new scholars you brought
in on Canvassing Day. You got a prize when
the next Canvassing Day came around, if they
were still there. And Canvassing Day was
nearly here again, and her scholars were failing
her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's no easy thing to be a Methodist," she
said in one of her moments of respite from a
little sister, talking about it with pride through
her gloom. "You work for all you get! When
I could look my scholars up every week, and
go by for 'em with Tom and the barouche when
the weather was bad, I had them there for
roll-call every Sunday. But now that I have
to hold my little sisters and we haven't Tom
or the barouche either because on account of
my little sisters we can't afford them, they've
backslid and dropped out."</p>

<p>Hattie had data as to that, too. "You
needn't be so bitter about it, Sadie. I know
you mean me! You went around and picked
your scholars up anywhere you could find 'em,
and I did too. It wasn't as if any one of 'em
had a call to your Sunday school. Or as if
they had a conviction. Except Mamie Sessums
whose conviction took her away."</p>

<p>Sadie spoke even more bitterly. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
needn't count on Mamie. Because she had had
a conviction that took her away from where
she was, I counted on her the most of any of
mine."</p>

<p>Hattie was positive. "But the conviction
she has now took her away from yours. Her
mother thinks there is too much about falling
from grace at your Sunday school; she doesn't
think it nice for little girls to hear so much
about sin."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't have fallen from grace herself
if I could have kept after her," from Sadie.
"If I hadn't to hold my little sisters Mamie
wouldn't be a backslider now. But my little
sisters will be justified to me yet. I'm not going
back on prayer."</p>

<p>It all emphasized the need of exceeding caution
in prayer. Emmy Lou never had thought
of it so. Time was, in fact, when, praying
her "Gentle Jesus," at Aunt Cordelia's knee,
she poured it out in Aunt Cordelia's lap, so to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
speak, and left it there. Not that Aunt Cordelia
had not made her understand that prayer
goes to God. But that Aunt Cordelia who attended
to everything else for her would see
about getting it there.</p>

<p>But that was when Emmy Lou was a baby
thing, and God the nebulous center of a more
nebulous setting, with the kindly and cheery
aspect as well as the ivory beard of&mdash;&mdash; Was
it Dr. Angell, the rector of St. Simeon's? Or
was there in the background of Emmy Lou's
memory a yet more patriarchal face, reverent
through benignity, with flowing ivory beard?
A memory antedating her acquaintance with
Dr. Angell? She was a big girl now, and God
was not quite so nebulous nor quite so cheery.
His ivory beard was longer, and in the midst
of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'nebulae'">nebul&aelig;</ins> for support was a throne. But He
yet could be depended on to be kindly. Aunt
Cordelia was authority for that.</p>

<p>Her concept of prayer, too, had moved forward;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
prayer in her mind's eye now taking the
form of little white cocked-hat <i>billets-doux</i>
winging out of the postbox of the heart, and,
like so many white doves, speeding up to the
blue of Heaven. If God was not too busy, or
too bothered, as grown people sometimes are
on trying days, she even could fancy Him
smiling pleasantly, if absently, as grown-up
people do, when the cocked-hat <i>billets-doux</i>, a
sort of morning mail, were brought in to
Him.</p>

<p>And so she was glad that Sadie was not
going back on prayer, but was sure that her
little sisters would be justified to her. Indeed,
her heart had gone out to Sadie about it, and
she had sent up <i>billets-doux</i> of her own, and
would send more, that the little sisters should
be justified to her.</p>

<p>But from this new point of view supplied
by Hattie, the winging <i>billets-doux</i>, as in the
mind's eye they sailed upward, seemed to droop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a little, weighted with the need of exceeding
caution in prayer. And in the light of this
revelation God in His aspect changed once
more, again gaining in ivory beard and in
throne what He again lost in cheer.</p>

<p>Long ago Aunt Cordelia used to rock her
to sleep with a hymn. Emmy Lou had thought
she knew its words, "Behind a frowning providence,
He hides a smiling face." Could she
have reversed it? She had been known to do
such things before. All this while had it been
saying: "Behind a smiling providence, He
hides a frowning face?"</p>

<p>At Emmy Lou's own home Aunt M'randy
the cook, like Hattie, seemed to feel that
prayer not sufficiently set around with safeguards
and specifications could prove a boomerang.
"Didn't I w'ar myse'f out with prayer
to get rid er that no-account nigger house-boy
Bob? To hev' thet prayer swing eroun' with
this worse-account house-boy, Tom?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom had gone to Hattie's house from Sadie's
where they no longer could afford to
have him, but he had not stayed there. He
didn't get along with the cook. From there
he came to be house-boy for Aunt Cordelia
where Bob couldn't get along with the cook.
Tom's idea of his importance apparently was
in the number of places he had lived, and his
qualifications he summed up in a phrase: "I
ca'ies my good-will with me to the pussons I
wuks foh."</p>

<p>The morning after Recruiting Sunday had
been announced at St. Simeon's Sunday school,
Uncle Charlie spoke of it at the breakfast table.
He didn't seem to think much of it, and referred
to it by another name, calling it an innovation.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise, on the contrary, defended it.
She was teaching in the Sunday school now.
"If everyone would show the energy and progressiveness
of Mr. Glidden since he took the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Sunday school," she said with spirit, "St. Simeon's
would soon look up."</p>

<p>"Glidden!" said Uncle Charlie. "Willie
Glidden! Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"Why you speak of him in that tone I don't
see, unless it is because you are determined to
oppose every innovation he proposes."</p>

<p>"I oppose his innovations?" heatedly. "On
the contrary I am in favor of giving him his
way so he may hang himself in his innovations
the sooner." And Uncle Charlie, getting up
to go downtown, slammed the door.</p>

<p>Which would have been astounding, Uncle
Charlie being jocular and not given to slamming
doors, had it not to do with that one of
the many worlds in the firmament of the Sundays,
St. Simeon's. Emmy Lou was glad she
understood these things better now. For persons
altogether amiable in the affairs of the
week-days to grow touchy and heated over the
affairs of Sundays is only a measure of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Christian zeal. There was comfort and reassurance
in the knowledge. Time was when
it would have frightened her to have Uncle
Charlie slam the door, and made her choke
over her waffle, and sent her down from her
chair and round to Aunt Cordelia for comfort
and reassurance.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise, addressing herself to Aunt
Cordelia in her place behind the coffeepot, still
further defended Mr. Glidden.</p>

<p>"He is even waking dear old Dr. Angell
a bit. Not that we don't love Dr. Angell as
he is, of course," hastily, "but he does lack
progressiveness."</p>

<p>"Which may be why some of us do love him,"
said Aunt Cordelia tartly. Aunt Cordelia!
Pleasant soul! Who rarely was known to sacrifice
good temper even to Christian zeal!
Emmy Lou choked on her waffle despite all!
"But don't draw me into it! I decline to take
sides."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which means, of course, that you've taken
one," said Aunt Louise. "As if I could ever
expect you to side with me against Brother
Charlie."</p>

<p>"And if I do agree with Charlie, what then?
To have the running of St. Simeon's passed
over his head to Willie Glidden! The church
our own grandfather gave the ground for!
And he the senior warden who has run St.
Simeon's his way for thirty faithful years!"</p>

<p>And Aunt Cordelia, getting up from behind
the coffeepot and going toward the pantry to
see about the ordering, broke forth into hymn,
as was her way when ruffled. Emphatic hymn.
And always the same hymn, too, Aunt Cordelia,
like Uncle Charlie, objecting to innovations.
Emmy Lou was long familiar with
this hymn as barometer of Aunt Cordelia's
state of being:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Let the fiery, cloudy <i>pillow</i>,"<br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>sang Aunt Cordelia, flinging open the refrigerator
door.</div>

<p>What it meant, a fiery, cloudy pillow, further
than that Aunt Cordelia was outdone,
was another thing. Emmy Lou always intended
to ask, but the very fact that Aunt
Cordelia only sang it when outdone prevented&mdash;that
and the additional fact that when Aunt
Cordelia was outdone Emmy Lou in distress
of mind was undone.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise waited until Aunt Cordelia,
who could be seen through the open doorway,
straightened up from her inspection of the
refrigerator. "Still," she said, "you won't
object that I entered Emmy Lou's name at
Sunday school yesterday as a recruiter? To
try her best and get a prize?"</p>

<p>"I do object if there are tickets about it,"
emphatically. "You can take care of them
for her if so. Willie Glidden has gone mad
over tickets. What with her blue tickets for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
attendance one place in my bureau drawer,
and her pink tickets for texts in another place,
I won't be bothered further."</p>

<p>Yet what were Sunday schools without tickets?
Emmy Lou getting down from the breakfast
table, her still unfinished waffle abandoned
for all time now, was dumbfounded. The one
thing common to all Sunday schools was tickets.
Though St. Simeon's under the accelerating
progressiveness of Mr. Glidden had gone
further, and whereas in ordinary your accumulated
tickets for every sort of prowess only
got you on the honor roll, a matter of names
on a blackboard, Mr. Glidden had instituted
what he called "a drawing card." At St. Simeon's,
now, when your blue tickets for attendance
numbered four&mdash;or five those months
when the calendar played you false and ran in
another Sunday&mdash;you carried these back and
got the Bible in Colors, a picture at a time.
And, incidentally, a color at a time, too. Emmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Lou had a gratifying start in these, last
month having achieved a magenta Daniel facing
magenta lions in a magenta den, and this
month adding a blue David with a blue sword
cutting off the head of a not unreasonably
bluer Goliath.</p>

<p>Pink tickets grow more slowly. Aunt Cordelia
said that she could see to it that Emmy
Lou got to Sunday school, but she could only
do her best about the texts.</p>

<p>And she did do her best, Emmy Lou felt
that she did.</p>

<p>"Say the text over on the way as you go,"
Aunt Cordelia had said to her as she started
only yesterday. "That way you won't forget
it before you get there."</p>

<p>And she had said it on the way, and had said
it in the class, too, when called on by Miss
Emerine.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia, plump and pleasant soul, had
ways of her own, and Emmy Lou in ways<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
even beyond the plumpness was modeled on
her. Aunt Cordelia said "were" as though it
were spelled w-a-r-e, and Emmy Lou said it
that way too.</p>

<p>"'And five ware wise, and five ware foolish,'"
Emmy Lou told Miss Emerine.</p>

<p>"Five what?" Miss Emerine asked, which
was unfortunate, this being what Emmy Lou
had failed to remember.</p>

<p>It was Tom, the new house-boy, who really
started Emmy Lou's recruiting for St. Simeon's.
Hearing Aunt Louise ask her what
she was doing about looking up new scholars,
he volunteered his help.</p>

<p>"There's a li'l girl up the street whar I
wuked once is thinkin' about changin' her Sunday
school. I'll tell her to come aroun' an'
see you."</p>

<p>The little girl came around promptly. It
was Mamie Sessums. Emmy Lou knew her at
week-day school. Far from being without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
conviction, as Hattie had claimed, she now had
two.</p>

<p>"My mother says Tom don't do anything but
try to have her change my Sunday school. He
lived with us before he went to live at Sadie's.
But she says she's very glad to have me stop
Hattie's and go with you. She didn't send
me there to have the minister go by our house
every day and never come in. Sadie's minister
never came to call on her when I went to that
Sunday school either. Do you have tickets at
your Sunday school?"</p>

<p>Tickets were vindicated. Emmy Lou hurried
upstairs and came back with all her trophies
of this nature. Mamie seemed impressed
by the Bible in Colors.</p>

<p>"You get them a picture at a time," Emmy
Lou explained. "The first one is Adam in
buff."</p>

<p>"Buff?" said Mamie doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Buff," repeated Emmy Lou firmly, since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
it was so, and not to be helped because Mamie
didn't seem to like it. "My Uncle Charlie
says so."</p>

<p>But it was only lack of familiarity with buff
on the part of Mamie. As a prize, it impressed
her. "I'll meet you on your church steps on
Recruiting Sunday," she said.</p>

<p>After Mamie left, Emmy Lou went around
to see Hattie. "Don't let it make you feel
bad, taking Mamie away from me," Hattie
told her. "I never expected anything else.
When it's not a call, nor even a conviction,
they're like as not to fail you on the very
doorstep."</p>

<p>Sadie, at her window holding a little sister,
waved to Emmy Lou and Hattie on the sidewalk.
It was hard Sadie couldn't be with her
friends any more. Emmy Lou sent up a <i>billet-doux</i>
that the little sisters might be justified
to Sadie yet. Poor Sadie!</p>

<p>It was Tom who told Emmy Lou where to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
go for her next recruit. She had no idea it
would be so easy. Sadie had worked hard for
all she got but it didn't seem hard to Emmy
Lou. "There's a li'l girl roun' on Plum Street
where I wuked once, too. I'll speak to her, an'
then you go roun' an' see her."</p>

<p>With Aunt Cordelia's permission, Emmy
Lou went around. It proved that she knew
this little girl at school, too. Her name was
Sallie Carter. She was the richest little girl
in the class and said so. Her curls shone like
Aunt Cordelia's copper hot-water jug, and
her skirts stood out and flaunted.</p>

<p>Sallie had convictions too. She had tried
Sadie's Sunday school while her own church
was being rebuilt, and she was just about
through trying Hattie's.</p>

<p>"My mother thinks it's strange that Tom
should be sending you after me too. Though
he did live with us before he lived with any of
you. She is surprised at some of the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
girls who go to Sadie's Sunday school. And
after she took me away they were the first little
girls I met on the steps at Hattie's Sunday
school. My mother says I'm a Carter on one
side and a Cannon on the other, and everybody
knows what that means. We're high church
and you are low, but she's glad to have me go
with you to St. Simeon's for a while and try
it. Do you have tickets?"</p>

<p>Tickets and more, the Bible in Colors. Emmy
Lou, explaining it, felt again she couldn't
sufficiently uphold tickets to Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>The very next day Tom came to Aunt Cordelia
and said if she would let Emmy Lou
go with him to Mr. Schmit's when he went to
get the ice, he knew of some other little girls
who might be persuaded to go to her Sunday
school. At Aunt Cordelia's word, Emmy Lou
got her hat and joined Tom with his basket.</p>

<p>The accustomed place to get extra ice before
Tom came was Mr. Dawkins' at the corner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
But Tom wouldn't hear of going to Mr. Dawkins'.
He argued about it until Aunt Cordelia
gave in. He said he used to live with Mr.
Schmit and drive his wagon.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou knew Mr. Schmit herself. Tom,
after an inquiry at the counter, took her
through the store to the back yard where he
left her, a back yard full of boxes and crates
and empty coops. Mr. Schmit's little girl Lisa
was here with a baby brother in her arms, and
another holding to her skirts, Yetta, her little
sister, and Katie O'Brien from next door completing
the group. Emmy Lou knew Lisa
and Katie at school, too. Lisa's round cheeks
were mottled and red, and the plaits hanging
down her back were yellow. She did not seem
overly glad to see Emmy Lou though she came
forward.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said.</p>

<p>It made it hard to begin. And even after
Emmy Lou had explained that she had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to get them to go to Sunday school Lisa was
unmoved.</p>

<p>"What do we want to go to Sunday school
for? If we wanted to go to Sunday school
we'd be going. We go to our grandfather's
in the country now on Sundays. That way we
get a ride in my papa's grocery wagon and we
get to the country too."</p>

<p>"But if you would," urged Emmy Lou, "it
would get me a prize."</p>

<p>"Sure I see," said Lisa. "I see that. But
if Katie here and Yetta and me give up our
ride out to my grandfather's, what do we get?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Emmy Lou, and hastened to set
forth St. Simeon's largesse and system in tickets.</p>

<p>"What do we do to get the tickets?" asked
Lisa. "We're Lutheran and Katie's Dominican.
I don't know as we'd be allowed to. We
wouldn't mind four Sundays and get a picture,
would we, Katie?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Katie, whose hair was black and whose eyes
were blue, agreed.</p>

<p>"Sure, we'd like a picture. But I don't
know as they'd let me at home. They said
I shouldn't go to no more Sunday schools.
The little girl who was sassy to us and said
they didn't want us there was at two Sunday
schools we've been to now."</p>

<p>"Still," said Lisa, "we'd like a picture.
Which one is your Sunday school?"</p>

<p>When Emmy Lou rejoined Tom, she was
overjoyed. "And they'll meet me on the
church steps too. All of 'em will meet me on
the church steps, Mamie and Sally and Lisa
and Yetta and Katie."</p>

<p>And now it was Recruiting Sunday. But
the shortness of manner with which Aunt Cordelia
tied Emmy Lou's hair-ribbons was not
on account of this, Recruiting Sunday for her
having taken its place among the minor evils.
Late on Saturday evening she had lost Tom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
a case again of the house-boy not getting on
with the cook.</p>

<p>"After I wore myse'f out with prayer to
git rid of thet no-account Bob, to have thet
prayer swing aroun' with this worse-account
Tom," was Aunt M'randy's explanation of the
disagreement.</p>

<p>"They want me over at Sadie's house tomorrow,
anyway," Tom said with feeling as
he went. "'Count of their grandfather walkin'
in on 'em f'om Kansas City sudden there's
big doin's hurried up about the twins. They're
goin' to have a barouche roun' f'om the livery
stable too, an' they want me to drive."</p>

<p>Then Tom became darkly cryptic. "I tol'
you when I come, I ca'ies my goodwill with
me to the pussons I wuks foh."</p>

<p>And now it was Sunday morning and no
house-boy. "Charlie," said Aunt Cordelia to
this person, "I wish you'd walk around to the
Sunday school door with Emmy Lou. She's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
never been so far alone. Louise is not ready,
and she's to meet all those children on the
church step where they'll be waiting for her,
and thinks she ought to be early."</p>

<p>"Surely," said Uncle Charlie. "I'm glad
to. I've an idea it's about time for Willie
Glidden to be hanging himself in some of his
innovations."</p>

<p>At the corner Uncle Charlie and Emmy Lou
met Tom coming back towards Sadie's with
the barouche from the livery stable. One felt
Tom saw them, though he looked the other
way.</p>

<p>At the second corner they met Sally Carter.
Her curls shone like Aunt Cordelia's copper
hot-water jug, and her skirts stood out and
flaunted. She stopped when Emmy Lou
stopped, but with reluctance, since it was
palpable she was in a hurry.</p>

<p>"I've decided I didn't treat Sadie right.
My name's still on her roll. Those little girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
my mother didn't want me to associate with
at the other Sunday schools were on your
church steps, anyway, and she wouldn't want
me to stay."</p>

<p>At the next corner they met Lisa and Yetta
and Katie, scoured and braided and in their
Sunday dresses. They didn't want to stop
either, palpably being in even a greater hurry.</p>

<p>"As long as we're goin' to Sunday school
we think well go back to the one we started
from," said Lisa. "That sassy little girl our
mothers said we shouldn't put up with was on
your church steps anyhow, and was sassy to
us some more."</p>

<p>At St. Simeon's itself they met Mamie. "I
didn't want to wait, but I felt I ought to.
I'm going back to Sadie's, and I'm late. Tom
called to us here on the steps as he went by
in the barouche, and said Sadie's little twin
sisters were going to be baptized at her church
right after Sunday school."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which," said Uncle Charlie the while his
Emmy Lou swallowed tears, "hangs Willie
Glidden neatly in his own innovations."</p>

<p>When Sadie and Hattie and Emmy Lou
met at school the next day, Sadie's eyes were
bright and her face shone. Why not? As she
pointed out, her little sisters were justified to
her, her erring scholars were returned, her
grandfather said he'd see to it that they <i>could</i>
afford to have Tom back and the barouche too,
and it all went to prove the efficacy of prayer.</p>

<p>It would seem to. That is, of Sadie's prayer.
Emmy Lou could see that. She indeed had
sent up <i>billets-doux</i> in Sadie's behalf herself.
But it did not explain everything.</p>

<p>"Mr. Glidden at my Sunday school prayed
too, that the least of these be brought into the
fold."</p>

<p>Hattie forgot her own right to grievance in
the joy of this additional data in support of
her position. Had she not claimed that an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
answer to prayer can be an answer and yet
be calamitous too?</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Hattie. "'The least of
these into the fold.' But he didn't say which
fold!"</p>

<p>Did not say which fold? To God who knows
everything? For Mr. Glidden meant his fold.
Hattie, then, was right?</p>

<p>The concepts of Emmy Lou, eight years old,
a big girl now, moved on again. Behind a
smiling providence God hides a frowning face.
And those winging <i>billets-doux</i>, already
weighted with caution and now heavy with
doubt, in the mind's eye faltered, hung, and
came fluttering, drifting, so many falling white
doves, wings broken, down from the blue.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PINK TICKETS FOR TEXTS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> walls of St. Simeon's conservatism had
fallen. St. Simeon's, with its arches above, its
pews below, their latched doors, as it were,
symbolic, the Old Dispensation depicted in
the window above its entrance doors, and St.
Paul, the apostle of the personal revelation,
smitten to his knees by light from Heaven, the
figure of the window above its chancel. Modern
progressiveness, the battering-ram in the
hands of Willie Glidden, come up through the
Sunday school himself but yesterday, had assailed
the defenses of an older generation successfully.</p>

<p>Or so Uncle Charlie seemed to think as he
repeated the news brought from Sunday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
school by Aunt Louise and Emmy Lou. "Dr.
Angell came into the Sunday school room this
morning and offered a rector's prize for pink
tickets earned for texts? Each child receiving
a pink ticket for every Sunday throughout the
year to be thus rewarded? Willie Glidden has
goaded him to this."</p>

<p>Mr. Glidden had goaded the rector of St.
Simeon's to other things which Emmy Lou,
nearing nine years, had heard discussed at
home.</p>

<p>"Popular heads to my sermons for the newspapers
and the bulletin board?" it was reported
that Dr. Angell had said indignantly. "Who
but Glidden wants notices in the papers or a
bulletin board either? For forty years I have
sedulously refrained from being popular, and
I'll not begin it now."</p>

<p>But he came to it, popular heads being furnished
by him weekly, in a dazed pother at finding
himself doing it, but still doing it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Prizes to encourage the Sunday school?"
so report said his comment was to this last
proposition. "Pay the children of my church
for doing their duty?"</p>

<p>But the report also said that he calmed down
on grasping that the proposition centered
about texts.</p>

<p>When Dr. Angell met the little people of
his flock in the company of their elders he
addressed them much after the same fashion.
"A big girl, now!" or "Quite a little man!"
he would say. "Old enough to be coming to
church every Sunday and profiting by service
and sermon."</p>

<p>"Sermon," said he, on occasion to a little
boy who said he didn't like sermons. "The
sooner you realize and profit by the knowledge
that life is one unending sermon, sirrah, the
better for you."</p>

<p>Dr. Angell had gathered his own sermons
into a book, as Aunt Cordelia told proudly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
strangers, a stout volume bound in cloth, with
a golden sun in a nimbus of rays stamped on
the cover, entitled "Rays from the Sun of
Righteousness."</p>

<p>And now, his attention caught and held by
the word "text," since from his viewpoint to
every sermon its text, and possibly to every
text its sermon, he was offering a rector's prize
for a year's quiver of pink tickets, these being
the visible show of as many correctly recited
texts.</p>

<p>"Will you have Emmy Lou try?" Aunt
Louise said to Aunt Cordelia. "We in the
Sunday school feel we should do all we can
to support Mr. Glidden."</p>

<p>But Aunt Cordelia needed no urging from
Aunt Louise. She did not feel that respect for
the institutions introduced at St. Simeon's by
Mr. Glidden that Aunt Louise felt, and did not
hesitate to say so. But anything inaugurated
by the rector of her church she did respect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"If Dr. Angell is offering the prize, certainly
Emmy Lou will try. A rector's, not a Willie
Glidden prize, is a different thing. It will be
something for her to esteem and value all her
life. I am sorry it is for texts." Evidently
the word had the same associations for Aunt
Cordelia that it had for Dr. Angell. "I have
trouble enough as it is in making her want to
stay to church."</p>

<p>Aunt Louise explained. "The prizes are
for the weekly texts heading the Sunday school
lessons. They have no connection with church
or the sermon."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not," Aunt Cordelia conceded,
"but if she is going to take a prize from
Dr. Angell for texts, and I shall see to it that
she does, it is no more than she ought to be
willing to do, to listen cheerfully to his sermons.
I have been too lenient in excusing her
from church."</p>

<p>On this same Sunday afternoon Emmy Lou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
went around to talk the matter over with Hattie,
and found Sadie there.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou and Hattie had been estranged,
their first misunderstanding, Emmy Lou, with
St. Simeon's back of her, having taken one
stand, and Hattie another.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou spoke of kneeling at her church
to pray and standing to sing and Hattie corrected
her. "Who ever beard of such a thing?
You mean stand to pray and sit down to sing."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou didn't mean anything of the
kind and said so.</p>

<p>Hattie faced her down. "Don't I go to
church? Doesn't Sadie go?" turning to this
person as referee. "Don't we know?"</p>

<p>Sadie was obliged to qualify her support.
"We don't <i>stand</i> to pray, we lean our foreheads
on the next pew."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou refused to be coerced. "I don't
stand to pray, or lean forward either. I kneel
down."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," said Hattie, "it must be because
you are what my father calls a bigoted Episcopalian,
that you don't. Everybody else stands
up or leans forward."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou had faced the chancel of her
church for four years. "St. Paul doesn't. He's
kneeling above our chancel."</p>

<p>"Then he must be a bigoted Episcopalian
too," said Hattie with feeling, and went home.</p>

<p>But today Hattie and Sadie, if anything,
were envious of Emmy Lou's opportunity. A
rector's prize!</p>

<p>Hattie, to be sure, with the books of the
Bible in her memory as were David's pebbles
in his scrip, once had felled the giant, Contest,
and won the banner for the girls over the boys
at her Sunday school. For which act of prowess
her teacher had rewarded her with a little
gold pin.</p>

<p>And Sadie had a workbox, a little affair
complete, scissors, thimble, and all, a recognition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of faithfulness at large, from her Sunday
school teacher, the same delivered to her by
the superintendent before the assembled Sunday
school. And as she pointed out, the calling
of her name and the walk up and down the
aisle to receive the gift were no small part of
the reward.</p>

<p>It did stagger them both that Emmy Lou
should have to stay to church. "Still," argued
Hattie, "it will be worth it, a rector's prize.
Though why you don't say preacher!"</p>

<p>"Or minister," said Sadie.</p>

<p>"My brother once got a silver dollar for a
prize that wasn't a dollar at all but a watch
made to look like a dollar," said Hattie.</p>

<p>"But not from church," Sadie reminded
her.</p>

<p>"No, from the President Dollar Watch
Company for guessing the pictures of the
presidents. But still it was a prize."</p>

<p>Sadie could supplement this. "My mamma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
heard of a little girl who sold tickets for a
picnic and won a locket on a chain."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou went home cheered. Aunt Cordelia
had put the emphasis on the texts whereas
Hattie and Sadie had put it on the prize.</p>

<p>"A silver dollar that wasn't a dollar but a
watch, and a locket on a chain," said Uncle
Charlie, overhearing her tell about it. "Well,
well!"</p>

<p>A rector's prize should indeed be something
worth the working for. Fifty-two pink tickets
standing for fifty-two correctly recited texts,
and attendance at church for fifty-two Sundays!</p>

<p>For Aunt Cordelia was as good as her word.
The next Sunday she and Uncle Charlie on
their road to St. Simeon's met Emmy Lou
returning from Sunday school. Hitherto on
these weekly encounters it was a toss-up whether
she should be allowed to proceed, or must
return to church.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>With Emmy Lou, face and eyes uplifted to
Aunt Cordelia, mutely interceding for herself,
while Uncle Charlie articulately interceded for
her, it was a stand-off whether or not she
should be required to go. And when the worst
happened and she must turn about and accompany
Aunt Cordelia, the propinquity of Uncle
Charlie in the pew beside her had helped her
through. Until recently he had slipped
smoothly rounded peppermints banded in red
from his vest pocket to her, or, the supply running
low, passed her his pencil and an envelope
to amuse herself. But she was a big girl now
and Aunt Cordelia no longer permitted these
indulgences.</p>

<p>"Sermons in pencils too, perhaps, Cordelia,"
Uncle Charlie pleaded, "and good in peppermints."</p>

<p>But in vain. "Charlie!" Aunt Cordelia but
remonstrated, shocked.</p>

<p>Nor was Emmy Lou to be excused today.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Aunt Cordelia, plump and comely in her furs
and ample cloak and seemly bonnet, and Uncle
Charlie in his top-coat, gray trousers, silk hat,
and natty cane, brought up short on meeting
her. Not that she, in a chinchilla coat suitable
for the big girl she was, and a gray plush
hat, with her hair tied with scarlet ribbons, had
much hope herself.</p>

<p>"I see you have your pink ticket in your
hand, a good beginning," said Aunt Cordelia.
"I'm glad you walked to meet us. You can
do so every Sunday; the change and relaxation
will do you good. Now, Charlie, not a word.
From now on, while she is trying for Dr. Angell's
prize, she will go back with us to
church."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou found herself there within a
very few minutes, the parallelograms of pews
about her filled with the assembled congregation,
she in her place between Aunt Cordelia
and Uncle Charlie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>And at home, where she now would be had
Aunt Cordelia relented, what? Her children
doomed to sit in a wooden row against the
baseboard until she arrived to release them.
The new book, for Emmy Lou is reading now,
left where one begins to divine that the white
cat in reality is a beautiful lady. Also at
home on Aunt Cordelia's table that Sunday
institution never forgotten by Uncle Charlie,
the box of candy, from whose serried layers
Emmy Lou may take one piece in Aunt Cordelia's
absence. Furthermore at home the
realm of the kitchen with its rites of Sunday
preparation, Aunt M'randy its priestess, and
delectable odors and savory steam arising from
its altar, the cooking-stove.</p>

<p>And in the stead for Emmy Lou a morning
spent in church. Still she can settle down and
think of the prize which as reward for all this
faithfulness will be hers. Think of Hattie's
gold pin, and Sadie's work-basket, of the silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
dollar which in reality was a watch, and
the locket on the chain.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia touches Emmy Lou, and,
brought to herself, she stands up. Aunt
Cordelia finds the place and hands her a
prayer book. Church has begun.</p>

<p>Amid form without meaning, and symbol
without clue, the mind of Emmy Lou wanders
again, this time to that puzzle, the adult,
no less impenetrable to the mind of nine than
the shrouded mystery of ancient Egypt to the
adult. For adults, Aunt Cordelia for one, here
beside her in the pew, love to go to church.
The proof? That they of their own volition,
since the adult acts of himself, are here.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia touches Emmy Lou. She
and Aunt Cordelia and Uncle Charlie and the
congregation of St. Simeon's, Hattie to the
contrary, kneel down.</p>

<p>But the mind continues to wander. The
adult is here because it wants to be here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
whereas Emmy Lou is here because Aunt Cordelia
says she must be. Her eyes, too, will
travel ahead on the prayer book page to the
amen. What amen? Any and all, since amens
wherever occurring signify the end of the
especial thing of the moment, whether said,
sung or prayed. The thought sustaining one
being that, amen succeeding amen, the final
and valedictory one is bound to come in
time.</p>

<p>"Get up for the Venite," whispers Aunt Cordelia,
and Emmy Lou who has lost herself
on her knees gets up, pink with the defection.
Not that the Venite has any significance to her
which brings her to her feet, but that to find
herself in the wrong situation at church, or
anywhere, is embarrassing.</p>

<p>This pitfall of ritual is called the service,
though it might be worse since the more service
the less sermon. As nearly as Emmy Lou can
grasp it, at Hattie's church, beyond a sparse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
standing up to pray, and sitting down to sing,
it is all sermon.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia has to speak to her by and
by again: "Get up for the Jubilate," Emmy
Lou having lost herself during the second lesson.</p>

<p>And yet? And yet? Can it be there is more
in this business of church than an Emmy Lou
suspects? The congregation now going down
on its knees for that matter called the Litany,
a tear presently splashes on the glove of Aunt
Cordelia kneeling beside Emmy Lou, her head
bowed above the big, cross-emblazoned prayer
book that she always uses.</p>

<p>Aunt Katie and Aunt Louise wear white
gloves or gray or brown as the case may be,
and feathers and flowers, and their dresses are
varied and cheery. But Aunt Cordelia still
wears black in memory of Emmy Lou's mother
who went away when Emmy Lou was four.
The tear falling on her black glove and sliding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
off to the book makes a stain tinged with purple
from the kid.</p>

<p>Then Emmy Lou remembers this is the
anniversary of the day her mother went forever,
and understands why the prayer book in
Aunt Cordelia's hand is open at the flyleaf
bearing the name of its first owner, Emily
Pope McLaurin.</p>

<p>Are we nearer our dead at church? And
being nearer, are we comforted? For when
Aunt Cordelia arises from her knees her face
is happy.</p>

<p>"The four hundred and ninety-fourth
hymn," she whispers. "Find the place."
Then in refutation of Hattie, "Stand up."</p>

<p>And Emmy Lou, finding the hymn for herself,
stands up and with Aunt Cordelia and
Uncle Charlie and the congregation, sings
heartily:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The Church's one foundation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is Jesus Christ her Lord&mdash;&mdash;"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>While the service thus drags its length along,
the hymn which Emmy Lou both can find for
herself and can sing heartily being the only
oasis in the desert of her morning, there is
worse ahead. Between two uprising peaks of
the amens, one of which is reached with the
close of the hymn, lies that valley of dry bones
called the sermon.</p>

<p>Dr. Angell is beginning it now. "'Thy word
is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my
path.'"</p>

<p>This seems a reasonably clear and definite
statement even to Emmy Lou, not quite nine
and slow to follow. But no.</p>

<p>"The Psalmist was given to imagery, which
is to say, was an Oriental," begins Dr. Angell.
And so one goes down with him into the
valley of dry bones.</p>

<p>The mind wanders anew. How can it help
wandering? Albert Eddie Dawkins is across
the church in a side pew with his big sister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Sarah. She has decided that he shall try for
a rector's prize too. He is low in his mind
about it, and said so to Emmy Lou coming out
of Sunday school this morning.</p>

<p>Joe Kiffin made a proposition to him that
he could not accept, Joe being the big boy who
drove the wagon and delivered for the Dawkins
grocery.</p>

<p>"He said he would take me and another boy
this morning to a place where we can get all
the honey locusts we want. A place where the
ground is covered with 'em. But we both had
to come to Sunday school and stay to church,
and Joe says we can't expect him to take us
in the afternoon when it's the only afternoon
he's got. You know honey locusts?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was compelled to admit that she
did not.</p>

<p>"Well," a little anxiously, "I don't either.
But if I and the other boy could have gone with
Joe, I'd have found out."</p>

<p>The other boy was at church too. By turning
her head the least bit Emmy Lou could see
him. His name was Logan. But he wasn't
trying for a prize. He said they might make
him stay to church&mdash;"they" meaning the grown
persons in the pew with him&mdash;but they couldn't
make him try for pink tickets, or walk up an
aisle to get a prize he mightn't want anyway.</p>

<p>Mightn't Logan want it? Was there any
chance that Emmy Lou would not want hers?
Fifty-two&mdash;no, fifty-one&mdash;Sundays now to
come, and with one pink ticket in hand, fifty-one
yet to be achieved for texts.</p>

<p>Dr. Angell is ending his sermon. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
so it comes that the words of the Psalmist occurring
in the liturgy of our service, are a lamp
unto our feet, and a light unto our path."
And he and his congregation come up out of
the valley of dry bones.</p>

<p>And yet? And yet? Emmy Lou's eyes,
fixed on Dr. Angell, are registering on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
retina of her mind for all time a figure which
for her shall be a type, dominant in its attitude
of beneficent authority, hands outspread
above its people, rumpled hair white, beard
white, robes white, a shaft of light from a
common window into heaven shared with him
by St. Paul, the bigoted Episcopalian, searching
him out where he stands.</p>

<p>As void of meaning to her, these gettings up
and these sittings down, these venites, jubilates,
and amens, as the purpose of Dr. Angell
in his chancel. Yet who shall say at what moment
Emmy Lou in her pew, struggling along
in the darkness though she is, shall sense the
symbol of the one, and behold in the other the
office and the appointment?</p>

<p>And the adult who is here of self-actuated
volition? The Aunt Cordelia ever in her place
in the family pew? Emmy Lou's eyes turn
to this person, and behold, her face is touched
as by a light, too, and her eyes are shining.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get up," she whispers as she herself arises,
"it is the benediction."</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie is jocular on the way home.
"And what did you think of the sermon?" he
asks Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>She does not know that he is jocular, nor
that she too, unwittingly, is the same in her
reply. "I thought I understood the text until
Dr. Angell began to explain it, and then I
lost it."</p>

<p>Fifty-one more Sundays, fifty-one more
sermons, fifty-one more texts between Emmy
Lou and her reward! The next Sunday and
there would be fifty, and the next forty-nine!</p>

<p>As the weeks went by Emmy Lou discussed
the prize with Aunt Cordelia, and incidentally
with Uncle Charlie who overheard the conversations.</p>

<p>"When Albert Eddie's mamma won a prize
for catechism in England where she lived when
she was little, it was tea to take home to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
mother, and a flannel petticoat for her grandma,
and she cried."</p>

<p>And again. "Sadie says it's an awful thing
when your name is called, to get up and walk
up the aisle, but Hattie says that you don't
mind it so much if you keep thinking about the
prize."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Papa came down once a month from his
home city a hundred miles away, to stay over
Sunday and see Emmy Lou. "I was going to
propose," he said on one of these visits, "that
the next time, you and Aunt Cordelia and
Uncle Charlie get on the train and come up to
visit me. But it's no use, I see."</p>

<p>"Not until I get my prize," said Emmy Lou.
"I have forty-one pink tickets in Aunt Cordelia's
bureau drawer, and today will make
forty-two."</p>

<p>"I am almost sorry I let her try," Aunt
Cordelia told her brother-in-law and Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Charlie. "She begins to study the text for the
next Sunday as soon as she gets home on
this."</p>

<p>Aunt Louise, as the allotted Sunday drew
near, brought home news of a tiff between Dr.
Angell and Mr. Glidden.</p>

<p>"Mr. Glidden told Dr. Angell today that
he had been looking over a printed list of Sunday
school prizes sent to superintendents, and
had noticed some excellent suggestions. Dr.
Angell was ruffled and said, 'If I'm fool
enough to come to prizes, bribes for duty, I'm
nevertheless still capable of providing them.'
I'm afraid he is getting old."</p>

<p>"Old," retorted Uncle Charlie. "It's being
goaded by Willie Glidden. Drive even a saint
too far and he will show his manhood."</p>

<p>"Hattie's is a little pin," remarked Emmy
Lou, even irrelevantly, "and Sadie's is a workbox,
and that other little girl's was a locket on
a chain."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The morning of the fifty-third Sunday came.
"I don't know which she is the more, proud, or
alarmed, at thought of walking up the aisle
this morning for her prize," said Aunt Cordelia
after Emmy Lou left the breakfast table.
"There are only three children who have come
through successfully in the whole Sunday
school, Charlie. A little girl named Puggy
Western, according to Emmy Lou, she herself,
and Albert Eddie Dawkins. Two of the
three are thanks to Sarah and myself, if I do
say it."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The moment was come. The Sunday school&mdash;Bible
Class, Big Room, and Infant Class&mdash;was
assembled. Mr. Glidden, with Dr. Angell
beside him, had arisen.</p>

<p>"One at a time, Puggy Western, Emily
Louise McLaurin, and Albert Edward
Dawkins come forward and receive their
prizes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Puggy Western went up first, in a brand-new
hat and coat for the occasion, and came
back.</p>

<p>Emily Louise McLaurin went up next in a
next-to-new coat and hat and dress, and
came back.</p>

<p>Albert Edward Dawkins, in a new suit and
his first high collar, went up and came back.
A hymn, and Sunday school was over, and all
ages and sizes crowded around the three to
see their similar rewards.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When Aunt Cordelia and Uncle Charlie on
their road to church met Emmy Lou this morning,
her eyes, like her late accumulation of
tickets, were pink. She to whom tears came
hard and seldom had been crying.</p>

<p>"And how about the prize?" asked Uncle
Charlie.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, tears stoutly held back, handed
it to him. He looked it over, opened it, read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
her name in inscription within, then lifted his
gaze to her.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be doggoned!"</p>

<p>"Charlie!" from Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I surely will. The same to the other two?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou nodded. There are times when
one cannot trust oneself to speak.</p>

<p>And when Uncle Charlie handed back the
volume stoutly bound in cloth, stamped with
a golden sun in a nimbus of rays, and bearing
for title, "Rays From the Sun of Righteousness,"
the nimbus surrounded, not a golden
sun, but a silver dollar held in place by Uncle
Charlie's thumb.</p>

<p>"A dollar that is only a dollar, and not a
watch," he explained regretfully. "But somewhere
in the week ahead we may be able to
overtake a locket on a chain." Then to Aunt
Cordelia, "I'll decide it this morning, Cordelia.
Emmy Lou is excused for today from
anything further in the nature of sermons."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The next Sunday Albert Eddie Dawkins
was absent from Sunday school. He had run
off, so his sister Maud explained, and could
not be found.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou heard more about it later on
from Albert Eddie himself. She also found
out what a honey locust is, though she had had
to wait a year to do so.</p>

<p>"I told Joe Kiffen if he'd take us to that
honey locust place now, that he said he would
last year, I'd stay away from Sunday school.
And he did. And here's one for you."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou took the pod and bit into it.
As solace and recompense she could have
wished for something more delectable.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>STERN DAUGHTER OF THE VOICE OF GOD</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Hattie's</span> rule of life was simple, but severe.
She set it forth for Emmy Lou. "Right is
right, and wrong is wrong, and you have to
draw the line between. And when you've
chosen which side you're on, you have to stand
by your colors."</p>

<p>She went on to diagram her meaning. "I
heard my father tell my brothers what it means
to stand by your colors. He said they couldn't
be too careful in their associates. That now
they've joined the League for the Right they
must show their faith by their works. You and
I can't associate with anyone who chooses the
other side either. If Lisa Schmit will go to
Sunday picnics, she's wrong, and you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
I have to show our colors and tell her so."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou hesitated at such consignment
of Lisa to the limbo defined as wrong, but Hattie
said she didn't dare hesitate. She even
showed a disposition to take Emmy Lou's
right of election into her keeping, saying if
she felt this way about it she'd speak for her.</p>

<p>"No, we won't come into your game of
prisoner's base," she told Lisa and Yetta at
recess; "we're going to have a game of our
own."</p>

<p>The contumely for the unfriendly act nevertheless
fell on Emmy Lou who knew them
best. "She's getting to be stuck up," Lisa said
bitterly to her own group, with a jerk of her
head toward Emmy Lou standing by Hattie.
"She won't play with Yetta and me any more
because our papa keeps a grocery."</p>

<p>"No such thing!" said Hattie. "She won't
play with you because you go to picnics on
Sunday."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Was this true? Or was it because Hattie
had told her she must not play with them because
they went to picnics on Sunday?</p>

<p>Hattie called this bringing of Lisa and
Yetta to judgment "drawing the line." It
was a painful process to the rejected. Lisa
went off with her face suffused and Yetta who
followed her was crying.</p>

<p>Next followed the case of Mittie Heinz
whose mamma kept a little shop for general
notions, a stock that Emmy Lou never had
been able to identify, often as she had been
there to buy needles or thread or cambric for
Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>Mittie read her storybook on the steps of
the shop on Sunday and Hattie explained to
her that this made it impossible to include her
in a game of catcher.</p>

<p>"Right's right, and wrong's wrong," she
said. "If we are going to draw the line we
have to draw it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"I read my books on Sunday," expostulated
Emmy Lou, for Mittie's startled face showed
surprise as she turned away, and her eyes
looked reproach at Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"But they are books you get out of your
Sunday school library, and don't count anyway
because you say you don't like them," from
Hattie.</p>

<p>This lamentable and unhappy knowledge of
good and evil was forced on Emmy Lou when
in the ascending scale of years she simultaneously
reached her ninth birthday, the Fourth
Reader, and the estate of bridesmaid to Aunt
Katie.</p>

<p>Life from this eminence appeared broad-spread
and beautiful, and diversified by variant
paths within the sweep of a far horizon until
now never suspected. But Hattie, youthful
Virgil to her youthful Dante, permitted personally
conducted excursions only, and these
along a somewhat monotonous because strait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and narrow path&mdash;all other roads, whether
devious or parallel, flower-bedecked or somber,
ascending or descending, leading but to questionable
ends.</p>

<p>The first travelers pointed out by Hattie
as trudging these alien roads were Lisa, Yetta,
and Mittie, as has been shown. The second
group journeying on an upland, flowery way
paralleling the strait and narrow path in general
direction, at least, were Alice, Rosalie,
and Amanthus. Charming names! Enchanting
figures!</p>

<p>School opened early in September. Alice,
Rosalie, and Amanthus, who were newcomers,
were given desks across the aisle from Emmy
Lou. Alice, seeing her earnestly scrubbing
her desk each morning before school and arranging
it for the day, laughed in her eyes.
Amanthus, seeing her test her pen and try her
ink for the coming ordeal of copybook, laughed
in her dimple. And Rosalie, asking her what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
she was hunting on the outspread page of her
geography, laughed aloud when Emmy Lou
replied that it was Timbuctoo, and that she
could find it easier if she knew whether it was
a country, or a mountain, or a river. On which
they all came across the aisle and hugged her.</p>

<p>"You said in class that the plural of footnote
was feetnotes," said Rosalie.</p>

<p>"You said, when the teacher held you down
about the spelling in your composition, that a
dog didn't have fore-feet but four feet," said
Amanthus.</p>

<p>"It's so funny and so dear," said Alice.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"You," said Amanthus, and they all kissed
her.</p>

<p>"Come and see us," said Rosalie; "we're your
neighbors now. We've moved in the white
house with the big yard on your square, and
Alice, our cousin, and her mother have come
to live with us. We've never been to a public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
school before. You live in a white house at
the other end of the square. We saw you in
the yard."</p>

<p>"I'll come this afternoon," said Emmy Lou,
"and I'll bring Hattie. I'll get her now so
she'll know you."</p>

<p>But Hattie declined to come. She shook
her head decidedly. "They've light dispositions
and I've not. My mamma said so about
some other little girls I couldn't get along with.
I don't want to come, and besides I'm not sure
I want to know them."</p>

<p>Which would imply that light dispositions
were undesirable apart from Hattie's inability
to get along with them! Hattie could be most
disturbing.</p>

<p>Towards noon a sudden shower fell, and the
class was told to remain in its room for recess
and eat its luncheons at its desks.</p>

<p>Across the aisle on the other side of Emmy
Lou sat Charlotte Wright. She, too, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
shown every disposition to be friendly but Hattie
discouraged this also. She leaned from
her desk now. "Will you have a piece of my
homemade hickory-nut candy?" She spoke
with pride. "My mamma let me make it myself
on the grate."</p>

<p>On the grate? Why not in the kitchen on
the stove? Still that was Charlotte's own affair.
More showy than tidy in her dress, she
seemed one of those detached and anxious little
girls hunting for friends. The kindly impulse
was to respond to overtures, Emmy Lou knowing
a past where she had needed friends. And
besides there was the candy. Hickory-nut
candy does not have to look tidy to look
good. She had a liberal lunch outspread on
the napkin upon her desk, but she had no
candy.</p>

<p>But Hattie leaving her desk and approaching,
held her back. "No, she won't have any
candy," she said, and gathering up Emmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Lou's lunch in the napkin and thus forcing
her to follow, walked away.</p>

<p>Whereupon Rosalie and Amanthus, arising
and going around to Charlotte, flung back their
curls as they crowded into her desk, one on
either side of her, and <i>asked</i> for a piece of her
candy.</p>

<p>"I don't say it wasn't hard to do," said Hattie,
flushed and even apologetic. "But I had
to. She's not your kind, and she's not mine."</p>

<p>Yet Rosalie and Amanthus were sharing
Charlotte's desk and her candy. Was she their
kind?</p>

<p>Hattie's voice had dropped and was even
awe-struck as she explained. "Charlotte's
papa and her mamma don't live together. I
heard my mother and my aunt say so. She
and her mother live in a boarding house next
to the confectionery."</p>

<p>In a boarding house? Charlotte through
necessity making her candy on a grate, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and not in the kitchen! And proof indeed
that she was not their kind, even to Emmy
Lou, in a day when the home, however small,
was the measure of standing and the rule!</p>

<p>Yet Alice has arisen and is looking across
at Charlotte. Emmy Lou loves Alice. Light
disposition or not, she is drawn to her. Her
hair is a pale gold while the curls of her cousins
are sunny, and her smile is in her reflective
eyes while theirs is in lip and dimple. Of
the three she loves Alice. Why? She has
no idea why. Alice moves forward suddenly
and going around to Charlotte leans to her
and kisses her.</p>

<p>"Is Charlotte their kind?" Emmy Lou asks
Hattie who also was watching.</p>

<p>"Ask them; they ought to know," tersely.
"We can't afford to care, even if it does make
us sorry. My father said people have to stand
by their colors."</p>

<p>Later as school was dismissed and the class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was filing out, Rosalie called to Emmy Lou,
"If you will go by for Charlotte, she says she
will come this afternoon, too."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou went home disturbed. Charlotte's
father and mother did not live together,
and because of this Charlotte was not their
kind.</p>

<p>Marriage then is not a fixed and static fact?
As day and night, winter and summer?
Would she yet learn that the other family relations
as brother and sister, parent and child,
are subject to repudiation and readjustment,
too?</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was just through serving as
bridesmaid for Aunt Katie, in a filmy dress
with a pink sash around what Uncle Charlie
said was by common consent and courtesy her
waist, whatever his meaning by this, and carrying
a basket from which she earnestly scattered
flowers up the aisle of St. Simeon's in
the path of the bride, and incidentally in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
path of Mr. Reade, the bridegroom, and had
supposed she now knew something about marriage.</p>

<p>The sanction of St. Simeon's was upon the
bride, crowned with the veil and orange blossoms
of her solemn dedication, or so the bridesmaid
had understood it.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hearing the holy priest that to her speakes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And blesseth her with his two happy hands!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Such in substance was the bridesmaid's understanding
of it, if not in just these words.</p>

<p>To be sure the occasion held its disappointment.
The concentration of gifts upon the
bride would argue that others shared with
Emmy Lou a sense of the inadequacy of the
bridegroom in his inglorious black clothes.</p>

<p>There was a steel engraving above the mantel
in the dining-room called "The Cavalier's
Wedding," at which Emmy Lou glanced again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
today as she came in, and in which the bridegroom
has a hat in his hand with a feather
which sweeps the ground, and wears a worthy
lace-trimmed coat.</p>

<p>At the dinner-table she repeated the news
which had so dismayed and astounded her.</p>

<p>"There's a little girl in my class named Charlotte
Wright whose papa and mamma don't
live together."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" expostulated Aunt Cordelia,
"I don't like you to be hearing such things."</p>

<p>This would seem to ratify Hattie's position.
"Then I mustn't play with her?"</p>

<p>"Why, Emmy Lou, what a thing for you
to say!"</p>

<p>"Then I can play with her?"</p>

<p>"The simple code of yea, yea, and nay, nay,"
said Uncle Charlie.</p>

<p>"Charlie, be quiet." Then to Emmy Lou,
"You mustn't pin me down so; I will have to
know more about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fancy I know the case and the child,"
said Uncle Charlie. "The father worked on
my paper for a while, a fine young fellow with
a big chance to have made good." Then to
Emmy Lou, "Uncle Charlie wants you to be
as nice to the little girl as you know how, for
the sake of the father who was that fine young
fellow."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was glad to get her bearings.
Hattie would be glad to get them too. The
status is fixed by a father and they could play
with Charlotte. One further item troubled.
"What are light dispositions?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Leaven for the over-anxious ones," said
Uncle Charlie. "If you meet any, pin to
them."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou turned to Aunt Cordelia. "May
I get Charlotte, then, and go to see Alice
Pulteney and Rosalie and Amanthus Maynard?
They've just moved on our square?"</p>

<p>"Agree, Cordelia, agree," urged Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Charlie as he arose from the table. "If we
are to infer they have light dispositions,
drive her to see Alice, Rosalie, and Amanthus."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou started forth by and by. The
shower of the morning was over and the September
afternoon was fresh and clear. It was
heartening to feel that she was standing by
her colors, by Charlotte, and going to see her
new friends.</p>

<p>The boarding house was unattractive and
the vestibule where Emmy Lou stood to ring
the bell embarrassed her by its untidiness.
As Charlotte joined Emmy Lou at the door,
her mother who had followed her halfway
down the stairs called after her. She was almost
as pretty as Aunt Katie, though she was
in a draggled wrapper more showy than tidy,
and she seemed fretful and disposed to blame
Charlotte on general principles.</p>

<p>"Now do remember when it's time to come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
home. Though why I should expect anybody
to remember in order to save me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rosalie and Alice and Amanthus were waiting
at their gate and led them in, not to the
house, but across the clipped lawn gleaming
in the slanting light of the mid-afternoon, to
a clump of shrubberies so old and hoary that
beneath their branches was the spaciousness of
a room. Here the ground was heaped with
treasure, a lace scarf, some trailing skirts,
a velvet cape, slippers with spangled rosettes,
feathers, fans, what not?</p>

<p>"I am the goose-girl waiting until the prince
comes," said Amanthus.</p>

<p>"I am the beggar-maid waiting for the
king," said Rosalie.</p>

<p>"I am the forester's foster-daughter lost in
the woods until the prince pursuing the milk-white
doe finds her," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Then in the twinkling of an eye our rags
will be changed to splendor," said Amanthus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
"There is a skirt for everyone and a feather
and a fan. Who will you be?" to Emmy Lou
and Charlotte.</p>

<p>They were embarrassed. "I never heard of
the goose-girl and the others," said Emmy
Lou. Nor had Charlotte.</p>

<p>Dismay ensued and incredulous astonishment.</p>

<p>A lady came strolling from the house across
the lawn. She was tall and fair, and as she
drew near one saw that her smile was in her
quiet eyes. Emmy Lou felt promptly that she
loved her.</p>

<p>"Mother," cried Alice.</p>

<p>"Cousin Adeline," cried Rosalie and Amanthus.</p>

<p>"Emmy Lou and Charlotte never have
heard of the goose-girl and the beggar-maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"May we have the green and gold book that
was yours when you were little, to lend them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice's mother, who was Mrs. Pulteney,
smiled at the visitors. "And this is Emmy
Lou? And this is Charlotte? Certainly you
may get the book to lend them."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou felt that one not only did well
to love Mrs. Pulteney but might go further
and adore her.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Charlotte should take
the book first. She kept it two days and
brought it to Emmy Lou, her small, thin face
alight. "I read it in school and got a bad
mark, but I've finished it. It all came right
for everybody."</p>

<p>She left an overlooked bookmark between
the leaves at the story of the outcast little
princess who went wandering into the world
with her mother.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou in her turn finished the book.
Charlotte got one thing out of it and she got
another. For Charlotte it all came right.
Emmy Lou entered its portals and the glory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of understanding came upon her. Looking
back from this land which is that within the
sweep of the far horizon, to the old and baffling
world left behind, all was made plain.</p>

<p>Even as Hattie drew a line between those
who are right and those who are wrong, so a
line is drawn between those who have entered
this land of the imagination and those who are
left behind. One knew now why Alice flits
where others walk, why the hair of Amanthus
gleams, why laughter dwells in the cheek of
Rosalie, why the face of Charlotte is transfigured.
And one realizes why she instinctively
loves Mrs. Pulteney. It is because she
owned the green and gold book when she was
little!</p>

<p>Emmy Lou also felt that she understood at
last why Mr. Reade made so poor a showing
as a bridegroom. It is because while every
goose-girl, beggar-maid, princess or queen
may be and indeed is a bride, there is nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
less than a prince sanctioned for bridegroom,
in any instance, by the green and gold book!</p>

<p>The glory of the green and gold book upon
her, Emmy Lou went to Hattie. But she declined
the loan of it, saying she didn't believe
in fairy tales. She had not believed in Alice,
Rosalie, and Amanthus at first, either, though
she had accepted them now.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou took this new worry home.
"Hattie doesn't believe in fairy tales."</p>

<p>"She will," from Uncle Charlie confidently.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When she gets younger, with time, like us,
or when she overtakes a light disposition looking
for an owner. But I wouldn't be hard
on her. Keep up heart and coax her along."</p>

<p>Hard on Hattie? Her best friend? Coax
her along? When were she and Hattie apart?</p>

<p>At Thanksgiving, Mrs. Maynard, the
mother of Amanthus and Rosalie, a close rival
herself to Aunt Katie in prettiness, gave a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
party for her two little daughters, a party calling
for white dresses and sashes and slippers.</p>

<p>"Hattie doesn't want to go, but I've coaxed
her," Emmy Lou reported at home.</p>

<p>"Doesn't want to go?" from Aunt Cordelia.
"Why not?"</p>

<p>"She says she hasn't got a disposition for
white dresses and slippers, she'd rather go to
parties with candy-pulling and games."</p>

<p>Christmas came, with a Christmas Eve pantomime
at the theater, which was given, so
Uncle Charlie said, because so many of what
he called the stock company were English.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pulteney gave a party to this pantomime
for Alice and her friends, and though
Uncle Charlie had asked Emmy Lou to go
with him, in the face of this later invitation he
withdrew his.</p>

<p>"You may give our tickets to Hattie and
Sadie if they are not already going."</p>

<p>Hattie had to be coaxed again. She said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
she didn't believe in theaters and felt she had
to stand by her colors. Her papa who chanced
along at the moment helped her decide.
"There's such a thing as making a nuisance of
your colors," he said, and took the tickets for
her from Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>A dreadful thing happened at school the day
before the Christmas holidays. A little girl
got mad at Alice. "We've all known something
about you and wouldn't tell it," she said,
while the group about the two stood aghast.
"Your papa and your mamma don't live together,
and that's why you live with Rosalie
and Amanthus. And it's true because it was
all in the paper."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou hurried home all but weeping
and told it.</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear, hush," said Aunt Cordelia.
"For the sake of Alice's brave mother we must
forget it. I hoped you would not hear it."</p>

<p>Alice's brave mother? Now the status is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
fixed by a mother. Life is perplexing. One
must explain to Hattie.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Christmas pantomime! Emmy Lou had
been to the theater before. Aunt Cordelia had
taken her to see "Rip Van Winkle."</p>

<p>"Uncle Charlie wants you to be able to say
you have seen certain of the great actors," she
had said, but Emmy Lou did not grasp that
she was seeing the actor until it was explained
to her afterward. She had no idea that a
great actor would be a poor, tottering old man,
white-haired and ragged, who brought tears to
the onlooker as he lifted his hand to his peering
eyes, standing there bewildered upon the stage.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise took her to another play called
"The Two Orphans." She understood this
less. "The name on the program is <i>Henriette</i>.
Why do they call it 'Onriette'? Is it a cold
in their heads?" She was cross and spoke fretfully
because she was bothered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>But the pantomime! Christmas Eve, the
theater brilliant with lights and garlands, evergreens
wreathing the box wherein she sat in
her new crimson dress with Alice, Rosalie,
Amanthus, and Charlotte, and Mrs. Pulteney
just behind&mdash;fair and lovely Mrs. Pulteney
who, like the mother of Charlotte, did not live
with her husband, though Emmy Lou is doing
her best to forget it.</p>

<p>The lights go down, the curtain rises, the
pantomime is beginning!</p>

<p>Can it be so? Palace and garden, an open
market-place, the public fountain, the shops
and dwellings of a town, and threading the
space thus set about, a crowding, circling
throng, jugglers, giants, dwarfs, fairies, a
crutch-supported witch, a white-capped baker!
It is the world of the green and gold book!</p>

<p>The goose-girl is here, about to put her teeth
into an apple. The beggar-maid and her king
are recognized. A princess and a prince, kissing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
their finger-tips to the boxes, are the center
of the stage.</p>

<p>No, <i>Harlequin</i> in his parti-colored clothes
with his dagger, whoever <i>Harlequin</i> may be,
is that center, causing the baker at a touch
to take off his head and carry it under his arm,
striking the apple from the lips of the goose-girl,
tipping the crown from the head of the
prince, twitching the scepter from the fingers
of the princess.</p>

<p>Clownery? Buffoonery? <i>Grotesquerie?</i>
Emmy Lou never suspects it if it be. Rather
it is life, which with the same perversity baffles
the single-hearted, bewilders the seeker, and
juggles with and decapitates the ideas even as
<i>Harlequin</i> dismembers the well-meaning and
unoffending baker. With this difference, that
in the world Emmy Lou is gazing on all will
be made right before the end.</p>

<p>The play moves on. Who are these who now
are the center of the scene? Emmy Lou has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
not met them before? Sad and lovely <i>Gabriella</i>
at her wheel in her woodland cottage,
in reality a princess stolen when in the cradle,
and <i>Bertram</i> her husband, forester of the ignoble
deeds, whose hands have wrung the white
doe's neck in wantonness.</p>

<p>And who are these as the play moves on?
<i>Florizel</i>, once high-hearted prince, forced to
dig in the nether world for gold to replace that
forever slipping through the unmended pocket
of <i>Gonderiga</i> his wife, standing by, princess
of the slovenly heart, who is no princess in
truth at all, but a goose-girl changed in the
cradle.</p>

<p>The play moves on to its close. The curtain
falls, the lights come up, the pantomime is
over.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Hattie and Sadie joined the box party at
the door of the theater and all went home together
on the street car. It was Christmas Eve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and the shops and streets were alight and
crowded. As the car reached the quieter sections
the lights of the homes shone through
the dusk.</p>

<p>Charlotte left the car at her corner which
was reached first, to go home to her mother in
the boarding house. Mrs. Pulteney and her
group of three said good-bye at the next corner.
At the third, Hattie, Sadie, and Emmy Lou
got off together.</p>

<p>Hattie detained the others ere they could
go their separate ways. Her voice was awed.</p>

<p>"Maybe Charlotte's father was like <i>Florizel</i>,
once high-hearted prince&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou and Sadie gazed at Hattie.
They caught the point. No wonder Hattie
was awed.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and maybe Mrs. Pulteney is beautiful
<i>Gabriella</i>&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That night after supper Emmy Lou paused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
before the picture of "The Cavalier's Wedding."
She was far from satisfied with Aunt
Katie's choice.</p>

<p>"Why did Mr. Reade wear those black
clothes?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" from Aunt
Cordelia.</p>

<p>But Uncle Charlie seemed to comprehend in
part, at least. "Those were the trappings and
the suits of woe."</p>

<p>"Woe?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. He was the bridegroom."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Hattie came around the day after Christmas.
Stern daughter of the voice of God in
general, today she was hesitant. "If you
haven't returned that book of fairy tales, I'll
take it home and read it."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<h2>IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SO BUILD WE UP THE BEING THAT WE ARE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Cordelia</span> stood behind Emmy Lou
who was seated at the piano with "Selections
From the Operas, for Beginners," open on the
rack. She paused in her counting. "Now try
it again by yourself. You have to keep time
if you want harmony."</p>

<p>Harmony? The mind of the performer
dwelt on the word as she started over again.
What is harmony?</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia relaxing her attention for the
moment turned to speak to Uncle Charlie who
was reading his paper by the droplight. "It's
no easy thing to bring up a child, Charlie." As
it happened, she was not referring to the practicing.
"Louise thinks Emmy Lou ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
be confirmed. She says now that she is eleven
years old she surely ought to know where she
stands."</p>

<p>It is no easy thing to be the child brought up
either, as Emmy Lou on the piano-stool could
have rejoined. Life and Aunt Cordelia might
perch her on the stool but, as events were
proving, that did not make her a musician.
Would going up the aisle of St. Simeon's
to kneel at the rail, she had watched the
confirmation class for some years now, make
her&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>What was it supposed to make her? An
Episcopalian? What is an Episcopalian? Did
she want to be one? Or did she want to be
what Papa is?</p>

<p>"Repeat, repeat," said Aunt Cordelia behind
her. "Don't you see the dots at the end
of the passage?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou repeated, came to the end of
her selection, and, to the relief of herself, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
least, got down. She was thinking about
Papa.</p>

<p>She had gathered from somewhere that
when Mamma after marriage left her church
and went with Papa to his church, there was
feeling.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou adored Papa. Aunt Cordelia
had a brother and two sisters to go with her to
St. Simeon's. Surely there should be someone
to go with Papa? But where? What was he?</p>

<p>Emmy Lou had asked this question outright
a good while ago. Papa was paying her a visit
at the time. Unknown to her he had looked
over her head at Aunt Cordelia and laid a
finger on his lips. Considering the extent and
the nature of his obligation to Aunt Cordelia,
possibly his idea was there must be no more
feeling, though Emmy Lou could not know
this.</p>

<p>Having thus communicated with Aunt Cordelia,
he answered the question. "Had my two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
grandfathers elected to be born on one side of
the Tweed and not the other, I probably would
have been an Episcopalian," he said.</p>

<p>"Tweedledee, in other words, instead of
Tweedledum," said Uncle Charlie.</p>

<p>All of which meant that Papa was not an
Episcopalian. What was he? Emmy Lou,
eight years old then and eleven now, was still
asking the question.</p>

<p>At bedtime Aunt Cordelia spoke again
about confirmation. "Think it over for the
rest of the week and then come tell me what
you have decided."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was glad to be alone in bed. At
eleven there is need for constant adjustment
and readjustment of the ideas and also for
pondering. The relations of one little girl to
Heaven and of Heaven to one little girl call
for pondering. People assort themselves into
Episcopalians, Methodists, and the like. Rebecca
Steinau is a Jew, Katie O'Brien is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Dominican, Aunt M'randy in the kitchen is an
Afro-American, her insurance paper entitling
her to one first-class burial says so. Mr. Dawkins'
brother is a Canadian; Maud and Albert
Eddie say their father sometimes is sorry he's
not a Canadian, too.</p>

<p>Is each of these assortments a religion? Or
all the assortments religion? Has God a special
feeling about having Emmy Lou an Episcopalian
when Papa is something else? Is it
not strange that He never, never speaks? In
which case she could ask Him and He would
tell her.</p>

<p>When Emmy Lou arrived at the grammar
school the next morning, for she is thus far on
the road of education now, Sadie and Hattie
had something to tell her.</p>

<p>There is a pupil in the class this year named
Lorelei Ritter. Emmy Lou has heard it
claimed by some that she can speak French,
by others that she speaks German. The fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
is self-evident that she speaks English. She
is given to minding her own affairs and in
other ways seems sufficient to herself. Miss
Amanda, the teacher, is pronouncedly cold to
her; they do not seem to get along.</p>

<p>"Where is the Rio de la Plata River, and
how does it flow?" Miss Amanda asked her in
the class only yesterday.</p>

<p>Lorelei had hesitated a moment. She was
plainly bothered.</p>

<p>"I thought <i>Rio</i> was river&mdash;&mdash;?" she began,
and stopped. Miss Amanda's face was red.</p>

<p>"Go to your seat," she said.</p>

<p>For what? How had Lorelei offended?
The class had no idea.</p>

<p>Miss Amanda had shown steady disapproval
of Lorelei before this, and this morning Sadie
and Hattie knew why.</p>

<p>"A girl in a class upstairs told us," said
Sadie. "Her name is Sally White and she
lives near Lorelei. She says Miss Amanda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
lives next door to Lorelei and they play the
piano at Lorelei's house all day Sunday with
the windows wide open."</p>

<p>"Tunes," Sadie went on to qualify. "It
isn't even as if it were hymns."</p>

<p>"Or voluntaries," said Hattie. Voluntaries
were permitted at Hattie's church before service
and Sadie did not approve of them.</p>

<p>Sadie was continuing. "Sally said the
neighbors sent word to the Ritters that it was
a thing a Christian neighborhood couldn't and
wouldn't put up with, but the Ritters go right
on playing."</p>

<p>This was more painful to Emmy Lou than
Sadie could know. Papa who comes to see
her once a month keeps the piano open on
Sunday, and plays what Sadie and Hattie differentiate
as "tunes" as opposed to hymns and
voluntaries, often as not dashing into what he
explains to Uncle Charlie is this or that from
this or that new opera.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>He plays at any and all times on Sunday,
dropping his paper or magazine to stroll to
the piano to pick and try, strum and hum, or
jerking the stool into place, to fall into sustained,
and to Emmy Lou who herself is still
counting aloud, breathless and incredible performance.</p>

<p>She is aware that Aunt Cordelia does not
willingly consent to this use of the piano on
Sunday, and she also is aware of a definite
stand taken by Uncle Charlie in the matter, to
which Aunt Cordelia reluctantly yields.</p>

<p>In the past Papa has been Papa, personality
with no detail, accepted and adored, just as
Aunt Cordelia has been and is Aunt Cordelia,
supreme and undisputed. But now Papa's
personality is beginning to have its details.
He still is Papa, but he is more. He is
tall and slight and has quick, clever hands,
and impatient motions of the head, together
with oddly regardful, considering, debating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
eyes, fixed on their object through rimmed eye-glasses.</p>

<p>Papa is "brilliant," vague term appropriated
from Uncle Charlie who says so. If he
were not a brilliant editor he would have been
a brilliant musician. Uncle Charlie says this
also.</p>

<p>And today at school Emmy Lou hears from
Sadie that piano playing on Sunday is a thing
a Christian neighborhood can't and won't put
up with!</p>

<p>"Aren't the Ritters Christians?" she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"How can they be when they play all day
Sunday?" Sadie returned. "Lorelei told Sally
that her father, Signor Ritter, was <i>Fra Diavolo</i>
in an opera once. And Sally says they
are proud of it and can't forget it. Every one
of the family plays on some instrument and
they take Sunday when they're all home to
play <i>Fra Diavolo</i> till the neighbors can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
stand it. Sally asked Lorelei what <i>Fra Diavolo</i>
means, and she said Brother Devil."</p>

<p>This again was information more painful
to Emmy Lou than Sadie could know. Papa
on his visits, while dressing in the mornings,
or later when wandering about the house or
running through the contents of some book
picked up from the table, breaks into song,
palpably familiar and favored song even if
absently and disjointedly rendered. Emmy
Lou has heard it often as not on Sunday.
Uncle Charlie in speaking of it once said it
was "in vogue"&mdash;another term appropriated
by Emmy Lou&mdash;when Papa was a young man
studying in Paris.</p>

<p>The song favored thus ended with up-flung
and gayly defiant notes and words that said
and resaid with emphatic and triumphant
finality, "<i>Fra Diavolo</i>"! Though what the
words meant Emmy Lou had no idea until
now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the Ritters are not Christians, what are
they?" she asked.</p>

<p>Sadie had information about this. "Sally
says the neighbors say they are Bohemians."</p>

<p>Unfortunately Emmy Lou has heard this
term before, though she had not grasped that
it was a religion. Aunt Cordelia frequently
worries over Papa.</p>

<p>"He's a regular Bohemian," she frets to
Uncle Charlie.</p>

<p>Before school was dismissed on this same
Friday, there were other worries for Emmy
Lou. When in time she arrived home, full of
chagrin, Papa was there for his usual visit
and wanted to hear about the chagrin and its
cause.</p>

<p>Words are given out in class at grammar
school, as Papa knows, to be defined and illustrated
by a sentence. One may be faithful to
the meaning as construed from the dictionary,
and lose out in class too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"A girl in the class named Lorelei Ritter
laughed at my sentence, and then the rest
laughed too."</p>

<p>"What was the word?" inquired Papa.</p>

<p>"Concomitant."</p>

<p>"And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"'A thing that accompanies.' He played
the concomitant to her song."</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie shouted, but Papa's laugh was
a little rueful. "Poor little mole working i'
the dark. Will the light never break for her,
Charlie, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>What did he mean, and why is he rueful?
Is the trouble with her who would give all she
is or hopes to be in adoring offering to Papa?
Can he, even in the light of what she has heard
today, be open to criticism? Certainly not.
Papa may be a Bohemian, and a Bohemian
may not be a Christian, but what he is that
shall Emmy Lou be also.</p>

<p>To decide is to act. Papa went down town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
after dinner with Uncle Charlie, and Emmy
Lou took her place at the piano. Ordinarily
she is loath to practice, going through the ordeal
because Aunt Cordelia requires it. But
today she goes about it as a practical matter
with a definite purpose.</p>

<p>Papa brought her the "Selections From the
Operas" some while back, with the remark that
a little change from exercises to melody might
introduce cheer into a melancholy business
all around. But so far this had not been
the result, "Selection No. 1&mdash;Sextette from
Lucia," reducing her to tears, and "Selection
No. 2&mdash;I Dreamt That I Dwelt in Marble
Halls," doing almost as much for Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>But now that Emmy Lou had a purpose, the
matter was different. There was a table of
contents to the "Selections From the Operas,"
and a certain title therein had caught her eye
in the past. Seated on the piano-stool, leaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
over the book on her lap, she passed her
finger down the list.</p>

<p>Selection 13. She thought so. She found
the page and replaced the open book upon the
rack. <i>Fra Diavolo</i>. She set to work. What
Papa is that will she be also.</p>

<p>She desisted by and by long enough to go
and ask a question of Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>"If I were to be confirmed at St. Simeon's
could I practice my selections on Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Practice them on Sunday?" Aunt Cordelia
had enough trouble getting her to practice
on week-days to be outdone with the question.
"Why do you ask such a thing? You
know you could not."</p>

<p>That night Emmy Lou asked Papa a question
a little falteringly: "Are you a Bohemian?"</p>

<p>"Instead, the veriest drudge you ever knew,"
he said. "There's too much on me, making a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
living for us both, to be so glorious a
thing."</p>

<p>Then what was Papa?</p>

<p>She went around to ask a question of Sadie
the next morning. She had been to Sadie's
church often enough to know that she liked
to go. The prayers were long but the singing
was frequent and hearty. No one need mark
the time at Sadie's church, the singing marking
its own time warmly and strongly until it
seemed to swing and sway, and Sadie sang and
Emmy Lou sang and everybody sang, and
Emmy Lou for one wasn't sure she did not
swing and sway too, and her heart was buoyant
and warm. She loved the songs at Sadie's
church; what matter if she did not know what
they meant?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh, there's honey in the Rock, my brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There's honey in the Rock for you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Leave your sins for the blood to cover,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There is honey in the Rock for you, for you."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>She could wish that Papa might be a Methodist.
It hardly was likely, all things considered,
but one could make sure.</p>

<p>"Would 'Selections From the Operas' be allowed
by your church on Sunday?" she asked
Sadie.</p>

<p>Sadie not only was horrified but, like Aunt
Cordelia, was outdone. "Why, Emily Louise
McLaurin, you know they would not be!" she
said indignantly.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou had no such desire for Papa to
be a Presbyterian. She had been with Hattie
often enough to know that the emphasis is all
on the sermon there. Hattie knew her feeling
and when inviting her to go put the emphasis
on the voluntary of which she was proud.</p>

<p>This very Saturday afternoon she came
around full of information and enthusiasm.
"Our soprano has done so well with her new
teacher, he is going to play our organ tomorrow
by request and she is going to sing a solo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
during the collection. I want you to come
from Sunday school and go."</p>

<p>She had other news. "I asked Lorelei Ritter
yesterday after school if she was a Bohemian
and she got mad. She said no, she
wasn't, she was a Bavarian."</p>

<p>Aunt Louise spoke to Aunt Cordelia that
night. "Emmy Lou must decide in the next
day or two if she is going to enter the confirmation
class this year; I have to report for her."</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and Emmy Lou
heard Papa humming and singing in his room
as he dressed, <i>Fra Diavolo</i> the burden of it.</p>

<p>The chimes at Sadie's church two squares
away, were playing,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"How beauteous are their feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who stand on Zion's hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who bring salvation on their tongues</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And words of peace reveal!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>From afar the triple bells of St. Simeon's
flung their call on the morning air. Nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Methodist nor yet Episcopalian would be singing
<i>Fra Diavolo</i> on Sunday morning as he
dressed. What was Papa?</p>

<p>What was he? As he and Emmy Lou went
down the stairs together to breakfast, she
caught his hand to her cheek in a sudden passion
of adoring. What Papa was, she would
be!</p>

<p>She hurried from Sunday school around to
Hattie's church on Swayne Street. Hattie
defended the absence of a bell by saying
they didn't need a bell to tell them when to
go to church; they knew and went.</p>

<p>It was a brick church, long built, and a
trifle mossy as to its foundations, discreet in
its architecture, and well-kept.</p>

<p>Hattie was waiting for Emmy Lou at the
door. Her very hair-ribbons, a serviceable
brown, exact and orderly, seemed to stand for
steadiness and reliability in conviction.</p>

<p>What did Emmy Lou's blue hair-ribbons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
stand for? Blue is true, and she would be true
to whatever the conviction of Papa.</p>

<p>"The strange organist is going to play the
voluntary too," Hattie explained. "It's almost
time for him to begin. Hurry."</p>

<p>As they went in, she told another thing:
"Lorelei and her mother are here, sitting in a
back pew."</p>

<p>There were two points of cheer in the service
at Hattie's church as Emmy Lou saw it,
the voluntary and the collection. She had referred
to this last as the offertory on a visit
long ago, but never would make the mistake
again, so sharply had Hattie corrected her.</p>

<p>Hardly were they settled in their places in
the pew with Hattie's father and mother, when
a large man with black hair and shaggy brows
made his way to the organ in the loft behind
the minister, and the voluntary began.</p>

<p>This the voluntary that along with hymns is
advocated for Sundays? This that stole over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the keys hunting the melody, to find it here
and lose it there, with a promise that baffled
and a familiarity which eluded, to overtake it
at length and proffer it in high and challenging
measure that said gayly and triumphantly
above the thunderous beat supporting it, in
all but words, <i>Fra Diavolo!</i></p>

<p>Hattie's face was shining! And the faces
of her mother, of her father, and of the congregation
around, radiated approval and satisfaction!</p>

<p>And in time the soprano of Hattie's church
arose in the loft above the minister, supported
by the choir. It was the collection.</p>

<p>It was more. It was "Selection No. 1&mdash;Sextette
from Lucia"! Though the words did
not say so!</p>

<p>Hattie, then, had not been blaming Lorelei
but defending her? It was Sadie who disapproved
of voluntaries and Lorelei?</p>

<p>Emmy Lou with heightened color, resolute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
face, and blue bows, arrived at home. She
went straight to Papa just returned from
Uncle Charlie's office and strumming on the
piano.</p>

<p>"You're a Presbyterian," she said.</p>

<p>"It sounds like an indictment," said Uncle
Charlie. "But he will have to own up. Admit
your guilt, Alec. How did you find it out?"</p>

<p>"Presbyterians play and sing 'Selections
From the Operas' on Sunday, and so does he."</p>

<p>"You look ruffled, Alec," from Uncle
Charlie, "But so does someone else. Your
cheeks are hot," to Emmy Lou. "Something
else is disturbing; out with it."</p>

<p>"The girl named Lorelei Ritter who laughed
at me Friday in class was at church and spoke
to me coming out."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said did I know it was her father who
played the concomitant to the soprano's
song?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Invite her round, and urge her to be
friendly," begged Uncle Charlie when he
stopped shouting. "We need her badly. Besides
I'm sure I'd like to know her."</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia came downstairs that night
after seeing Emmy Lou to bed. "Whatever
is to be done with the child? Has she talked
to you, Alec? She says she can't be confirmed
because she is going to be a Presbyterian. And
then she cried bitterly. They stand up to pray
and sit down to sing, she told me desperately.
That if it was right&mdash;which it wasn't, of course,&mdash;she'd
wish people didn't have to be Episcopalians
or Bohemians or Presbyterians, but
just Christians. I told her I thought we would
drop the question of confirmation until next
year."</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SO TRUTH BE IN THE FIELD</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A year</span> later Sarah, the sister of Albert Eddie
Dawkins, saw him through the six weeks
of the confirmation class, up the aisle of St.
Simeon's and confirmed. The next day she
started to England to visit her mother's people
who had prospered.</p>

<p>"In a way I can feel he is safe now," she said
to Aunt Louise at Sunday school on the day
of his confirmation. "I wasn't easy about him
before, if he is my brother. If he'll only go
ahead now, he'll do."</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia saw Emmy Lou through the
same class of preparation, up the aisle and
confirmed, and then came home and had a
hearty cry. She who always claimed she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
too busy seeing to meals, the house, and those
within it, to give way!</p>

<p>"I am sure she is where her mother would
have her," she said to Aunt Louise through
her tears. "And her father would not hear to
the alternative when I offered to discuss it. If
only I can feel that in time she will be <i>what</i>
her mother would have her!"</p>

<p>This seemed to put the odium on Emmy Lou
in the event of failure. She would be thirteen
years old in another month, her cheek-line was
changing from round to oval, she was preparing
for the high school, and her waist, according
to Miss Anna Williams, the seamstress
who made her confirmation dress, is coming
round to be a waist.</p>

<p>She looked in distress at Aunt Cordelia who
was drying her eyes in vain since the tears were
continuing, and who seemed far from reassured
that she will be what her mother would
have her. There was nothing for it in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
face of the implication but for Emmy Lou to
throw herself into Aunt Cordelia's lap and cry
too. After which the atmosphere cleared, the
normal was resumed, and everybody felt better.</p>

<p>Sarah, who spoke with more flattering certainty
about the future of Albert Eddie, wore
her hair coiled on her head now, and her skirts
were long. Capable, dependable, and to the
point as ever, she was a young lady.</p>

<p>When Aunt Cordelia, accompanied by
Emmy Lou, went to do her marketing the Saturday
before Sarah left for England, her
mother called her down to say good-bye.</p>

<p>"It's a long journey for you at eighteen,
Sarah," said Aunt Cordelia, "and we will be
glad when we hear you have reached its end
safely."</p>

<p>"I can trust Sarah; I always could," said
her mother. "If anything goes wrong she'll
just have to remember what her grandmother,
my mother, used to say to her when she was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
wee 'un, and prone to fret when matters snarled
and she found she couldn't right 'em, 'When
you get to wit's end you'll always find God
lives there.'"</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia shook hands with Sarah, but
Emily Louise, as many persons now called
her, went up on her toes and kissed her.</p>

<p>"You must ask the prayers of the church for
the preservation of all who travel by land and
by water," Aunt Cordelia said to Mrs. Dawkins,
"and we ourselves must remember her in
our prayers. We will miss you, Sarah, in the
singing of the hymns on special days and Wednesday
evenings when we haven't a choir. I'm
glad you went to the organist and had those
lessons. A fresh young voice, sweet and strong
and sure, like yours, can give great comfort
and pleasure."</p>

<p>Hattie was a member of her church now, and
Sadie of hers. Rosalie, Alice, and Amanthus
were making ready for confirmation at St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Philip's which was high church. All had gone
their ways, each to the portal of her own persuasion,
as it were, and knocked and said, "I
am informed that by this gate is the way
thither."</p>

<p>And in answer the gate which is the way
thither, according to the understanding of
each, had opened and taken the suppliant in
and closed behind her.</p>

<p>Which, then, is the gate? And which the
way? Each and all so sure?</p>

<p>Time was, before the eyes of Emmy Lou
were opened, when she supposed there was but
one way. She even had pictured it, sweet and
winding and always upward.</p>

<p>This was at a time when Sarah gathering
Maud and Albert Eddie and Emmy Lou
around her in the sitting-room above the grocery,
about the hob, which is to say the grate,
sang them hymns. It was from one of these
hymns that Emmy Lou had pictured the way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
By cool Siloam's shady rill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How fair the lily grows,</span><br />
How sweet the breath beneath the hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Sharon's dewy rose.</span><br />
</div>

<p>According to Sarah's hymns there were two
classes of travelers on this sweet and goodly
way.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Children of the Heavenly King,<br />
As ye journey sweetly sing!<br />
</div>

<p>These Emmy Lou conceived of first. Later
she saw others of whom Sarah sang, less buoyant,
less tripping, but with upturned faces no
less expectant.</p>

<div class='poem'>
And laden souls by thousands meekly stealing<br />
Kind Shepherd turn their weary steps to Thee.<br />
</div>

<p>Emmy Lou listening to Sarah's hymns even
saw these welcomed.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Angels of Jesus,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>Angels of light,<br />
Singing to welcome<br />
The pilgrims of the night.<br />
</div>

<p>But that was time ago. There is no one and
common road whose dust as it nears Heaven is
gold and its pavement stars. Each knocks at
the portal of his own persuasion and says, "I
am informed that by this gate is the way
thither."</p>

<p>But Albert Eddie, having entered his portal,
was in doubt. "What is it she wants me to do
now I'm in?" he said to Emmy Lou, by "she"
meaning Sarah, and by "in," the church of his
adoption. His question began in a husky mutter
of desperation and ended in a high treble
of exasperation. Or was it merely that his
voice was uncertain?</p>

<p>For to each age its phenomena, as inevitable
as inexplicable. Albert Eddie's voice these
days was undependable. Emmy Lou felt an
uncharacteristic proneness to tears. Rosalie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
said it would be wisdom teeth next for everybody
all round.</p>

<p>But if Albert Eddie seemed baffled and hazy
as to what his duties were following confirmation,
Aunt Louise left no doubt with Emmy
Lou. The confirmation had been in May, and
now a week later lawns were green and lilacs
and snowballs in bloom.</p>

<p>"Now that you are a member of the church
you can't begin too soon to take your place
and do your part," Aunt Louise told her.
"The lawn f&ecirc;te is Thursday night on the Goodwins'
lawn. I am going to give you ten tickets
to sell, and send ten by you to Albert Eddie
since Sarah is not here to give them to him."</p>

<p>Emmy Lou took the tickets prepared to do
the best she could. She had had experience
with them before. It is only your friends who
take them of you, as a necessity and a matter
of course, a recognized and expected tax on
friendship, as it were.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Associates who are not intimates decline.
One named Lettie Grierson, in declining Emmy
Lou's tickets now, voiced it all.</p>

<p>"Why should I buy tickets from you? You
never bought any from me."</p>

<p>Hattie took one and said she'd go home and
get the money and bring it round.</p>

<p>When she arrived that afternoon she
brought a message from home with the money.
"Mamma says to tell you our church is going
to have a lecture on the Holy Land on the
twenty-fifth."</p>

<p>Sadie was present, having come to pay for
her ticket. "Our Sunday school is going to
have a boat excursion up the river in June.
The tickets will be twenty-five cents," she told
Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>Rosalie arrived a bit later with the money
for her ticket. "Alice and Amanthus can't
go. They went to Lettie Grierson's church
concert last week and I didn't. I can go if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
I may come and go with you from your house."</p>

<p>These three tickets thus disposed of, Emmy
Lou's own, and the three taken by Uncle
Charlie for the rest of the household made a
fairly creditable showing.</p>

<p>Albert Eddie had less luck. Maud, his sister,
so he explained, had been ahead of him,
and wherever he might have gone, she had
been.</p>

<p>"Joe Kiffin, our driver, took one, though he
won't go, and the other one I've sold is for
myself."</p>

<p>He seemed worried. "I tried," he said. "I
promised Sarah I'd try every time it was put
up to me."</p>

<p>It was arranged that not only Rosalie but
Hattie and Sadie should come and go with
Emmy Lou. When they arrived, on the day,
about five o'clock, each had her ticket and her
money.</p>

<p>A lawn f&ecirc;te for the church is no unmercenary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
matter. Your ticket only admits you to
the lantern-hung grounds, which is enough for
you to expect, and once within you have to buy
your supper. That it is paid for and eaten
largely by those whose homes have donated it
has nothing to do with the matter, Aunt Cordelia
having been notified that her contribution
would be beaten biscuit, a freezer of ice-cream
and chickens.</p>

<p>In this case there must be carfare also, the
Goodwins and their lawn being half an hour's
ride by street car from the center of things.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia came to the door with Emmy
Lou to meet the three. "Go ahead," she said.
"Louise is already there and will look after
you. Eat your suppers when you prefer.
Charlie and I will come later and bring you
home."</p>

<p>The four found Albert Eddie at the corner
waiting for the car. His hair was very, very
smooth, and his Sunday suit was spick and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
span as if Sarah were home to see to it instead
of well on her way to England, her rules and
regulations evidently being of a nature to stay
by one.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was an ordeal for Albert Eddie
to have four girls descend on him, for he turned
red and cleared his throat as though forced into
declaring himself in maintaining his ground.
Emmy Lou was his friend, and ignoring the
others he addressed her.</p>

<p>"Maud went ahead with some friends of her
own," he explained. "She said they wouldn't
want me."</p>

<p>The obvious thing was to ask him to go with
them. Had Emily Louise been speaking for
herself alone, she would have done so, Albert
Eddie being her friend and going to her Sunday
school. On the other hand, his father kept
a grocery at the corner just passed, and lived
over it with his family. He wasn't the friend
of her three companions and he didn't go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
their Sunday school. Emily Louise understood
many things which Emmy Lou wot not of.
Would they want him?</p>

<p>Verging' on thirteen, one has heard this nature
of thing and its distinctions discussed at
home.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise objected to certain associates
of Emily Louise not long ago. "It's why I
am and always have been opposed to the public
school for her. She picks up with every class
and condition."</p>

<p>"And why I have opposed your opposition,"
returned Uncle Charlie, "since it is her best
chance in life to know every class and condition."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know why she should,"
Aunt Louise had said.</p>

<p>"An argument in itself in that you <i>don't</i>
know," from Uncle Charlie.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Emily Louise in the present
case of Albert Eddie, twelve verging on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
thirteen was yet democratic. "We'll all go
together," said Hattie as a matter of course,
and the others agreed.</p>

<p>Hattie, as ever, was marshal and spokesman.
They boarded the car and sat down. "Fifty
cents all around to begin with," she stated
after fares were paid and the common wealth
displayed. "Five cents put in for carfare.
Forty-five cents left all around. Five cents
to come home on, five cents to spend, and
thirty-five cents for supper just makes it."</p>

<p>Church creeds and nomenclatures may vary
but the laws of church f&ecirc;tes and fairs are the
same. As the five left the car and approached
the Goodwins' home, Whitney and Logan
were patrolling the sidewalk outside the gate
and the lantern-hung yard from whence arose
the hustle and chatter of the lawn f&ecirc;te.</p>

<p>Logan wore a baker's cap and carried a tray
hung from his neck and piled with his wares,
which a placard set <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thereamong'">there among</ins> proclaimed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
be "Homemade Caramel Taffy, Five a Bag."
Whitney was assisting Logan to dispose of his
wares.</p>

<p>The two stopped the five. "We haven't a
show against the girls on the inside to sell anything,"
they said. "Buy from us."</p>

<p>"Five cents for a bag all around and forty
cents left, five cents to get home and thirty-five
cents for supper," from Hattie the calculator,
who liked to keep things clear.</p>

<p>Five bags were being exchanged for five
cents all around when an elderly gentleman
came along. Negotiations with the five being
held up while he was pressed to buy candy, he
brusquely replied that he had no change.</p>

<p>Neither had Logan or Whitney, business
having been brisker than they admitted. But
they did not let that deter them from cornering
the gentleman into a showdown. Nor did
a two-dollar bill, when produced, bother them.</p>

<p>Whitney had heard the financial status of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the five just outlined by Hattie, and did some
creditable calculating himself. Like Hattie
he was good at figures.</p>

<p>"You have five forties between you," he
said. "You take the bill and let us have the
change. You'll get it fixed all right when you
get your suppers."</p>

<p>The party of five was loath but saw no way
out of it. Held up, as it were, they reluctantly
gave over their forty cents around and pinned
their gazes anxiously on the two-dollar bill in
the hand of the elderly gentleman.</p>

<p>He seemed no better pleased than they,
showing indeed a degree of temper unbecoming
under the circumstances and using language
somewhat heated for a church fair.</p>

<p>"What in heaven's name do I want with
caramel taffy without a tooth in my head that's
my own?"</p>

<p>He thrust the bill at Albert Eddie who took
it hastily, and the five moved on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was it?" Sadie asked Emmy Lou and
Albert Eddie, since this was their lawn f&ecirc;te.
"He's coming in the gate behind us. Do you
know?"</p>

<p>Unfortunately they did. It seemed to detract
from that cordiality of welcome they
would prefer to associate with their lawn
f&ecirc;te.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Goodwin," Emily Louise told
them. "It's his house and yard. He must just
be getting home."</p>

<p>One's friends are loyal. Hattie covered the
silence. "His wife must have said they could
have it here before she asked him. I've known
it to happen so before."</p>

<p>"We'll go get our suppers," said Albert
Eddie anxiously. "That way we'll each get
our carfare back and it'll be off our minds."</p>

<p>They found Emmy Lou's Aunt Louise under
a grape-arbor, dishing ice-cream from a
freezer into saucers on the ground around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
it. A great many things are in order at a
church f&ecirc;te that would not be tolerated at
home.</p>

<p>"Go get your suppers," she said to the
group. "I'm busy and will be; don't depend
on me for anything."</p>

<p>The party of five took their places about a
table a few moments after. Two of them
were familiar figures in the Big Room at St.
Simeon's Sunday school. The three young
ladies who rushed up, tray in hand, to wait on
them, were far, far older&mdash;eminent representatives
of that superior caste of St. Simeon's
Sunday school, the Bible Class.</p>

<p>It was a friendly rivalry that was on among
the three, each waitress of the evening endeavoring
in her earnings to outstrip and eclipse
all other waitresses and so carry off the glory
of the occasion. In the present instance the
swiss apron and cap with the yellow ribbons
won out, and the other two waitresses withdrew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
with laughter and recrimination of a
vigorous nature, leaving the party of five
overwhelmed by the notice from the surrounding
tables and the publicity thus brought upon
them.</p>

<p>The wearer of the swiss apron with the yellow
ribbons was an arch and easy person, overwhelming
her five charges further with offhand
and jocose remarks indicative of condescension
as she brought five suppers, substantial, lemonade,
ice cream and cake, put them down, and,
as it were, got through with it.</p>

<p>Even to the payment. And as Albert Eddie
produced a two-dollar bill and she took it,
she was easily, superlatively, meaningly arch
as she said,</p>

<p>"We don't give change at church fairs to
gentlemen."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Uncle Charlie, with Aunt Cordelia, taking
the party home, paid everyone's carfare but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Albert Eddie's. When the time came for leaving
he could not be found.</p>

<p>"We lost him right after supper," Hattie
explained.</p>

<p>"As soon as he heard us say you were coming
to get us," from Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"He didn't eat any supper, just pretended
to," from Sadie. "He was trying not to cry."</p>

<p>"Sadie!" from Rosalie.</p>

<p>"We never, never should tell it if he was,"
from Hattie.</p>

<p>"Logan and Whitney said he left early,"
said Rosalie, "that he told them he would have
to walk home."</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie deposited the members of
the party at their several homes and then, being
the editor of a newspaper, went back downtown.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou, oftener than she could enumerate,
had waked in the past to hear him on his
return in the late, or, to be exact, the early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
hours, stop at Aunt Cordelia's door with news
that the world would hear the next morning.</p>

<p>She waked at his return tonight. He did
more than tap at Aunt Cordelia's door, he went
in. Hearing Aunt Cordelia cry out at his
words, Emmy Lou went hurriedly pattering
in from her adjoining room. As she entered,
the door on the opposite side of the room
opened and Aunt Louise came in, slipping on
her bedroom wrapper.</p>

<p>The light was on and Aunt Cordelia was
sitting up in bed with tears running unrestrainedly
down her face.</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie, about to explain to Aunt
Louise, looked at Emmy Lou and hesitated.</p>

<p>"No, go on," Aunt Cordelia told him. "She
is a big girl and must hear these things from
now on with the rest of us."</p>

<p>Uncle Charlie, reflective for a moment,
seemed to conclude she was right and went on.</p>

<p>"The ship on which Sarah Dawkins crossed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
foundered on the rocks off the Irish coast in
a heavy sea this morning and went to pieces
against the cliffs in the sight of shore. The
dispatches report only three persons saved,
and tell of a cook who went about with pots of
coffee, and of a girl named Sarah Dawkins
who gathered some children about her and
whose voice could be clearly heard by those on
shore in the lulls of the storm singing hymns to
them to the end."</p>

<p>Something happened to Uncle Charlie's
voice. After finding it he went on. "I hurried
right home. It's past twelve, Cordelia, but
don't you think you had better dress and let
me take you up to Mrs. Dawkins at once?"</p>

<p>Emmy Lou crept into Aunt Cordelia's bed
as Uncle Charlie went out and Aunt Cordelia
got up and began to dress hastily.</p>

<p>Strange tremors were seizing Emmy Lou,
but she must not weep, must not detain or distract
Aunt Cordelia. She was a big girl and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
must hear and bear these things now with the
rest.</p>

<p>"The child, the poor, poor child, alone on
that great ship without kith or kin!" said Aunt
Cordelia as she fastened her collar, still weeping.
Then she came and kissed Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>"I may be gone some time. Stay where you
are and I'll leave the light."</p>

<p>Did the tears come before or after Aunt
Louise kissed and soothed her and then went
back to bed? Emmy Lou rather thought they
came after she was gone. And after the tumult
of tears had spent themselves?</p>

<p>A picture arose in her mind, unbidden and
unexpected, of Albert Eddie, hurt, mortified,
and outraged, walking home block after block
from the lawn f&ecirc;te because church fairs do not
give any change.</p>

<p>"What is it she wants me to do now I'm in?"
he had asked following his confirmation.</p>

<p>And what was it that Sarah did want of Albert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Eddie? Sarah who saw him confirmed
and left next day? Sarah assembling the children
on the ship and singing hymns to them to
the end?</p>

<p>And suddenly Emmy Lou, twelve years old
verging on thirteen, saw for the first time!</p>

<p>Sarah dependably mixing the Saturday baking
in the crock, Sarah looking after her
younger sister and brother as best she knew
how, Sarah singing hymns to them sitting
about the hob, which is the grate, was being
made into that Sarah who could gather the
children about her on the sinking ship and sing
to them to the end. Not Sarah mixing the
baking in the crock, but Sarah <i>dependably</i>
mixing the baking in the crock. Herein came
the light.</p>

<p>And all the while Emmy Lou had thought
the digit on the slate in its day was the thing,
and later the copybook, and only yesterday,
the conjugation of the verb. Whereas Sarah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
now had shown her what nor home, nor school,
nor Sunday school, nor confirmation class had
made her see, that the faithfulness with which
the digit is put on the slate, the script in the
copybook, and the conjugation of the verb on
the tablets of the mind, is the education and
the thing!</p>

<p>This, then, is the gate? This the way that
leads thither? The sweet and common road
along which the children of the Heavenly King
are journeying? Faithful little Sister from
the alley of so long ago, gentle and loving Izzy
of that same far-gone day, Hattie helping a
schoolmate comrade over the hard places? This
is the road whereon those older, laden souls are
stealing? The road, if once gained by the pilgrim,
whether he be Episcopalian, Bohemian,
Presbyterian, or Afro-American, on which he
will go straight onward. The path where, like
bells at evening pealing, the voice of Jesus
sounds o'er land and sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Sea? Prayers of the church were asked that
Sarah be preserved from the perils of land and
water! And Sarah was lost!</p>

<p>Lost? Was Sarah lost?</p>

<p>"We'll miss your voice, so sweet and strong
and true, in the hymns," Aunt Cordelia had
told Sarah.</p>

<p>Would her voice be missed? Her voice singing
to the children to the end? It came with
a flash of sudden comprehension to Emmy Lou,
lying there in Aunt Cordelia's big bed waiting
for her return, that Sarah's voice would not be
missed but heard forever, singing hymns to
the end to those little children of the King.</p>

<p>"What does she want me to do now I'm in?"
asked Albert Eddie. Sarah had answered him.
Make himself ready for whatsoever part should
be his.</p>

<p>"The child, the poor, poor child, alone on
that great ship without kith or kin!" Aunt Cordelia
had said, weeping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Was she thus alone? "When you get to wit's
end you will always find God lives there," her
grandmother had told her when she was a wee
'un. Had not Sarah given proof that when
she got to wit's end God did live there?</p>

<p>Emmy Lou was weeping no longer. She
lay still. A wonder and an awe suffused her.
To the far horizon the landscape of life was
irradiated. She was tranquil. The Silence
had spoken at last.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Aunt Louise remarked to Aunt Cordelia a
few days later, "Did I tell you that we made
a hundred and fifty dollars at the lawn f&ecirc;te?"</p>

<p>"By fair means or foul?" asked Uncle Charlie,
overhearing. "I must say, Louise, in the
name of the church I stand for, I don't like
your methods."</p>

<p>Perhaps Uncle Charlie and Emily Louise
were seeing the same thing, Albert Eddie, hurt,
mortified, and outraged, walking home in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
night because St. Simeon's lawn f&ecirc;te didn't
give change to gentlemen.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia spoke after Emmy Lou went
up to bed. "She brought home her report of
the final examinations from school today. She
got through!"</p>

<p>"By the skin of her teeth as usual?" from
Uncle Charlie.</p>

<p>"Just that. She works so hard to so little
end, Charlie. I don't understand it. But at
least she is always faithful."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
